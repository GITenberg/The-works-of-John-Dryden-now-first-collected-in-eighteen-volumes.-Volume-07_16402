<h3 class="chap">THE DUKE OF GUISE.</h3>

<p>In the latter part of Charles the Second's reign, the stage, as well
as every other engine which could affect the popular mind, was eagerly
employed in the service of the contending factions. Settle and
Shadwell had, in tragedy and comedy, contributed their mite to the
support of the popular cause. In the stormy session of parliament,
in 1680, the famous bill was moved, for the exclusion of the
Duke of York, as a papist, from the succession, and accompanied
by others of a nature equally peremptory and determined. The
most remarkable was a bill to order an association for the safety
of his majesty's person, for defence of the protestant religion, for
the preservation of the protestant liege subjects against invasion
and opposition, and for preventing any papist from succeeding to
the throne of England. To recommend these rigid measures, and
to keep up that zealous hatred and terror of the catholic religion,
which the plot had inspired, Settle wrote his forgotten tragedy of
"Pope Joan," in which he revives the old fable of a female pope,
and loads her with all the crimes of which a priest, or a woman,
could possibly be guilty. Shadwell's comedy of the "Lancashire
Witches" was levelled more immediately at the papists, but interspersed
with most gross and scurrilous reflections upon the
English divines of the high church party. Otway, Lee, and Dryden
were the formidable antagonists, whom the court opposed to
the whig poets. Thus arrayed and confronted, the stage absolutely
foamed with politics; the prologues and epilogues, in particular
formed channels, through which the tenets of the opposite
parties were frequently assailed, and the persons of their leaders
and their poets exposed to scandal and derision.</p>

<p>In the middle of these political broils, Dryden was called upon,
as he informs us, by Lee, to return the assistance which that poet
had afforded in composing "&OElig;dipus." The history of the
Duke of Guise had formerly occupied his attention, as an acceptable
subject to the court after the Restoration. A League,
formed under pretence of religion, and in defence of the king's authority,
against his person, presented facilities of application to the
late civil wars, to which, we may be sure, our poet was by no
<span class="pgnm">004</span><a id="page_004" name="page_004"></a>
means insensible. But however apt these allusions might have
been in 1665, the events which had taken place in 1681-2 admitted
of a closer parallel, and excited a deeper interest. The
unbounded power which Shaftesbury had acquired in the city of
London, and its state of factious fermentation, had been equalled
by nothing but the sway exercised by the leaders of the League
in the metropolis of France. The intrigues by which the Council
of Sixteen placed and displaced, flattered or libelled, those popular
officers of Paris, whom the French call <i>echevins</i>, admitted of a direct
and immediate comparison with the contest between the
court and the whigs, for the election of the sheriffs of London;
contests which attained so great violence, that, at one
time, there was little reason to hope they would have terminated
without bloodshed. The tumultuous day of the barricades, when
Henry the second, after having in vain called in the assistance of
his guards, was obliged to abandon his capital to the Duke of
Guise and his faction, and assemble the states of his kingdom at
Blois, was not entirely without a parallel in the annals of 1681.
The violence of the parliament at London had led to its dissolution;
and, in order to insure the tractability of their successors,
they were assembled, by the king, at Oxford, where a concurrence
of circumstances rendered the royal authority more paramount
than in any other city of the kingdom. To this parliament the
members came in an array, which more resembled the parliament
of the White Bands, in the reign of Edward the second, than any
that had since taken place. Yet, though armed, and attended
by their retainers and the more ardent of their favourers, the leaders
of opposition expressed their apprehensions of danger from the
royal party. The sixteen whig peers, in their memorable petition
against this removal, complained, that the parliament would at
Oxford be exposed to the bloody machinations of the papists and
their adherents, "of whom too many had crept into his majesty's
guards." The aid of ballads and libellous prints was called in, to
represent this alteration of the usual place of meeting as a man&oelig;uvre
to throw the parliament, its members, and its votes, at the
feet of an arbitrary monarch<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_1-1">[1]</a>. It is probable that this meeting,
<span class="pgnm">005</span><a id="page_005" name="page_005"></a>
which rather resembled a Polish diet than a British parliament,
would not have separated without some signal, and perhaps bloody
catastrophe, if the political art of Halifax, who was at the head
of the small moderate party, called Trimmers, joined to the reluctance
of either faction to commence hostilities against an enemy
as fully prepared as themselves, had not averted so eminent a crisis.
<span class="pgnm">006</span><a id="page_006" name="page_006"></a>
In all particulars, excepting the actual assassination, the parliament
of Oxford resembled the assembly of the States General at
Blois. The general character of the Duke of Monmouth certainly
had not many points of similarity to that of the Duke of Guise;
but in one particular incident his conduct had been formed on that
model, and it is an incident which makes a considerable figure in
<span class="pgnm">007</span><a id="page_007" name="page_007"></a>
the tragedy. In September l679, after the king's illness, Monmouth
was disgraced, and obliged to leave the kingdom. He retired
to Holland, where he resided until the intrigues of Shaftesbury
assured him the support of a party so strongly popular,
that he might return, in open defiance of the court. In the
November following, he conceived his presence necessary to animate
his partizans; and, without the king's permission for his return,
he embarked at the Brill, and landed at London on the 27th,
at midnight, where the tumultuous rejoicings of the popular party
more than compensated for the obscurity of his departure<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_1-2">[2]</a>. This
<span class="pgnm">008</span><a id="page_008" name="page_008"></a>
bold step was, in all its circumstances, very similar to the return
of the Duke of Guise from his government to Paris, against the
express command of Henry the second, together with his reception
by the populace, whom he came prepared to head in insurrection.
Above all, the bill of exclusion bore a striking resemblance to the
proceedings of the League against the King of Navarre, presumptive
heir of the throne, whom, on account of his attachment to the
protestant faith, they threatened to deprive of the succession.</p>

<p>The historical passages, corresponding in many particulars with
such striking accuracy, offered an excellent groundwork for a political
play, and the "Duke of Guise" was composed accordingly;
Dryden making use of the scenes which he had formerly written on
the subject, and Lee contributing the remainder, which he eked
out by some scenes and speeches adopted from the "Massacre of
Paris," then, lying by him in manuscript. The court, however,
considered the representation of the piece as at least of
dubious propriety. The parallel was capable of being so extended
as to exhibit no very flattering picture of the king's politics; and,
on the other hand, it is possible, that the fate of the Duke of Guise,
as identified with Monmouth, might shock the feelings of Charles,
and the justice of the audience.</p>

<p>Accordingly, we learn from the "Vindication," that the representation
of the piece was prohibited; that it lay in the hands
of the lord chamberlain (Henry Lord Arlington) from before
mid-summer, 1682, till two months after that term; and that
orders were not finally given for its being acted until the month
of December in the same year. The king's tenderness for the
Duke of Monmouth had by this time so far given way, that he
had ordered his arrest at Stafford; and, from the dark preparations
on both sides, it was obvious, that no measures were any
longer to be kept betwixt them. All the motives of delicacy and
prudence, which had prevented the representation of this obnoxious
party performance, were now therefore annihilated or overlooked.</p>

<p>Our author's part of the "Duke of Guise" is important, though
not of great extent, as his scenes contain some of the most striking
political sketches. The debate of the Council of Sixteen, with which
the play opens, was his composition; the whole of the fourth act,
which makes him responsible for the alleged parallel betwixt Guise
and Monmouth, and the ridicule cast upon the sheriffs and citizens
of the popular party, with the first part of the fifth, which implicates
him in vindicating the assassination of Guise. The character
and sentiments of the king, in these scenes, are drawn very closely
after Davila, as the reader will easily see, from the Italian original
subjoined in the notes. That picturesque historian had indeed
anticipated almost all that even a poet could do, in conveying a
portraiture, equally minute and striking, of the stormy period
which he had undertaken to describe; and, had his powers of description
<span class="pgnm">009</span><a id="page_009" name="page_009"></a>
been inferior, it is probable, that Dryden, hampered as
he was, by restraints of prudence and delicacy, would not have
chosen to go far beyond the authority to which he referred the
lord chamberlain. The language of the play, at least in these
scenes, seldom rises above that of the higher tone of historical
oratory; and the descriptions are almost literally taken from Davila,
and thrown into beautiful verse. In the character of Marmoutiere,
there seems to be an allusion to the duchess of Buccleuch
and Monmouth, whose influence was always, and sometimes
successfully, used to detach her husband from the desperate
schemes of Shaftesbury and Armstrong. The introduction of the
necromancer, Malicorn, seems to refer to some artifices, by which
the party of Monmouth endeavoured to call to their assistance the
sanction of supernatural powers<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_1-3">[3]</a>. The particular story of Malicorn
is said to be taken from a narrative in Rosset's <i>Histoires
Tragiques</i>, a work which the present editor has never seen. In
the conference between Malicorn and Melanax, Dryden has made
much use of his astrological knowledge; and its mystical terms
give a solemnity to the spirit's predictions, which was probably
deepened by the poet's secret belief in this visionary study.
As he borrowed liberally from Davila in the other parts of the
play, he has not here disdained to use the assistance of Pulci,
from whose romantic poem he has translated one or two striking
passages, as the reader will find upon consulting the notes. The
last scene betwixt the necromancer and the fiend is horribly fine:
<span class="pgnm">010</span><a id="page_010" name="page_010"></a>
the description of the approach of the Evil One, and the effect
which his presence produces upon the attendants, the domestic
animals, and the wizard himself, is an instance, amongst many, of
the powerful interest which may be produced by a judicious appeal
to the early prejudices of superstition. I may be pardoned, however,
when I add, that such scenes are, in general, unfit for the
stage, where the actual appearance of a demon is apt to excite
emotions rather ludicrous than terrific. Accordingly, that of
Dryden failed in the representation. The circumstance, upon
which the destruction of the wizard turns, is rather puerile; but there
are many similar fables in the annals of popular superstition<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_1-4">[4]</a>.</p>

<p>Lee's part of this play is, in general, very well written, and contains
less rant than he usually puts in the mouths of his characters.</p>

<p>The factions have been long at rest which were so deeply agitated
by the first representation of this performance; yet some
pains has been taken to trace those points of resemblance, which
gave so much offence to one party, and triumph to the other.
<span class="pgnm">011</span><a id="page_011" name="page_011"></a>
Many must doubtless have escaped our notice; but enough remains
to shew the singular felicity with which Dryden, in the present
instance, as in that of "Absalom and Achitophel," could adapt
the narrative of ancient or foreign transactions to the political
events of his own time, and "moralize two meanings in one word."
Altogether abstracted from this consideration, the "Duke of
Guise," as a historical play, possesses merit amply sufficient to

<p>The play was first acted 4th December, 1682, and encountered
a stormy and dubious, if not an unfavourable, reception. But as,
the strength of the court party increased, the piece was enabled to
maintain its ground with more general approbation. It was performed
by the united companies, and printed in 1683.</p>

justice of the execution may, I think, be questioned, unless, like Cinna the

a cut, representing the king with a double face, carrying the house of

called the mayor of Hatfield, setting forth, that, on the 24th of
January, the apparition of a woman, all in white [the Duke of Monmouth's
mother was here to be understood], with a white veil over her face, accosted
her with these words; 'Sweetheart, the 15th of May is appointed for the
blood-royal to be poisoned. Be not afraid, for I am sent to tell thee.' That
on the 27th the same appearance stood before her again, and she having

you.' That on the 26th, it appeared to her a third time, but said only, 'Do
your message;' and that on the next night, when she saw it for the last time,
it said nothing at all. Those, who depend upon the people for support, must
try all manner of practices upon them, and such fooleries as these sometimes
operate more forcibly than experiments of a more rational kind. Care was
besides taken to have this relation attested by Sir Joseph Jordan, a justice of
peace, and the rector of Hatfield, Dr Lee, who was one of the king's

<li><a id="Guise_1-4" name="Guise_1-4"></a><p>In truth, the devil and the conjuror did not always play upon the square,
but often took the most unfair advantages of each other. There is more than
one instance of bad faith in the history of that renowned enchanter, Peter
Fabel. On one occasion, he prevailed upon the devil, when he came to
carry him off, to repose himself in an enchanted chair, from which he refused
to liberate him, until he had granted him an additional lease of seven years.
When this term was also expired, he had the eloquence and art to prevail
on the fiend to allow him a farther respite, till a wax taper, then nearly expiring,
was burned out. This boon being granted, he instantly put out the
light, and deposited the taper in the church at Edmonton. Hence, in Weiver's
"Funeral Monuments," he is thus mentioned: "Here (at Edmonton)
lieth interred, under a seemly tombe without inscription, the body of Peter
Fabell, as the report goes, upon whom this fable was fathered, that he,
by his wittie devices, beguiled the devill." p 514. See also the <i>Book of
his Merry Prankes</i>. Another instance occurs, in the famous history of
Friar Bacon, (London 1666) where that renowned conjurer is recorded
to have saved a man, that had given himself to the devil on condition of
his debts being paid. "The case was referred to the friar. 'Deceiver
of mankind, said he (speaking to the devil), it was thy bargain never
to meddle with him so long as he was indebted to any; now how canst
thou demand of him any thing, when he is indebted for all he hath to thee?
When he payeth thee thy money, then take him as thy due; till then thou
hast nothing to do with him; and so I charge thee to be gone.' At this the
devil vanished with great horrour; but Fryar Bacon comforted the gentleman,
and sent him home with a quiet conscience, bidding him never to pay
the devil's money back, as he tendred his own safety, which he promised for
to observe." From these instances, Melanax might have quoted precedent
for insisting on the literal execution of his stipulation with Malicorn, since,
to give the devil his due, the strict legal interpretation appears always to have
been applied to bargains of that nature.</p></li>

<h3 class="chap">TO
THE RIGHT HONOURABLE
LAWRENCE,<br />
EARL OF ROCHESTER, &amp;c.<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_2-1">[1]</a></h3>

<p class="noind smcap">My Lord,</p>

<p>The authors of this poem present it humbly to
your lordship's patronage, if you shall think it worthy
<span class="pgnm">014</span><a id="page_014" name="page_014"></a>
of that honour. It has already been a confessor,
and was almost made a martyr for the royal
cause: but having stood two trials from its enemies,&mdash;one
before it was acted, another in the representation,&mdash;and
having been in both acquitted,
it is now to stand the public censure in the reading:
where since, of necessity, it must have the
same enemies, we hope it may also find the same
friends; and therein we are secure, not only of the
greater number, but of the more honest and loyal
party. We only expected bare justice in the permission
to have it acted; and that we had, after a
severe and long examination, from an upright and
knowing judge, who, having heard both sides, and
examined the merits of the cause, in a strict perusal
of the play, gave sentence for us, that it was neither
a libel, nor a parallel of particular persons<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_2-2">[2]</a>.
In the representation itself, it was persecuted with
so notorious malice by one side, that it procured us
the partiality of the other; so that the favour more
than recompensed the prejudice. And it is happier
to have been saved (if so we were) by the indulgence
of our good and faithful fellow-subjects, than
by our own deserts; because, thereby the weakness
of the faction is discovered, which, in us, at that
time attacked the government, and stood combined,
like the members of the rebellious League, against
the lawful sovereign authority. To what topic will
they have recourse, when they are manifestly beaten
from their chief post, which has always been
popularity, and majority of voices? They will tell
us,&mdash;that the voices of a people are not to be gathered
in a play-house; and yet, even there, the enemies,
as well as friends, have free admission: but,
<span class="pgnm">015</span><a id="page_015" name="page_015"></a>
while our argument was serviceable to their interests,
they could boast, that the theatres were true
protestant; and came insulting to the plays, when
their own triumphs were represented<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_2-3">[3]</a>. But let
them now assure themselves, that they can make
the major part of no assembly, except it be of a
meeting-house<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_2-4">[4]</a>. Their tide of popularity is spent;
<span class="pgnm">016</span><a id="page_016" name="page_016"></a>
and the natural current of obedience is, in spite of
them, at last prevalent. In which, my lord, after
the merciful providence of God, the unshaken resolution,
and prudent carriage of the king, and the
inviolable duty, and manifest innocence of his royal
highness,&mdash;the prudent management of the ministers
is also most conspicuous. I am not particular
in this commendation, because I am unwilling to
raise envy to your lordship, who are too just, not to
desire that praise should be communicated to others,
which was the common endeavour and co-operation
of all. It is enough, my lord, that your own part
was neither obscure in it, nor unhazardous. And
if ever this excellent government, so well established
by the wisdom of our forefathers, and so much
shaken by the folly of this age, shall recover its ancient
splendour, posterity cannot be so ungrateful as
<span class="pgnm">017</span><a id="page_017" name="page_017"></a>
to forget those, who, in the worst of times, have
stood undaunted by their king and country, and,
for the safeguard of both, have exposed themselves
to the malice of false patriots, and the madness of
an headstrong rabble. But since this glorious work
is yet unfinished, and though we have reason to
hope well of the success, yet the event depends on
the unsearchable providence of Almighty God, it is
no time to raise trophies, while the victory is in dispute;
but every man, by your example, to contribute
what is in his power to maintain so just a cause,
on which depends the future settlement and prosperity
of three nations. The pilot's prayer to Neptune
was not amiss in the middle of the storm:
"Thou mayest do with me, O Neptune, what thou
pleasest, but I will be sure to hold fast the rudder."
We are to trust firmly in the Deity, but so as not
to forget, that he commonly works by second
causes, and admits of our endeavours with his concurrence.
For our own parts, we are sensible, as
we ought, how little we can contribute with our
weak assistance. The most we can boast of, is,
that we are not so inconsiderable as to want enemies,
whom we have raised to ourselves on no other
account than that we are not of their number; and,
since that is their quarrel, they shall have daily occasion
to hate us more. It is not, my lord, that
any man delights to see himself pasquined and affronted
by their inveterate scribblers; but, on the
other side, it ought to be our glory, that themselves
believe not of us what they write. Reasonable men
are well satisfied for whose sakes the venom of their
party is shed on us; because they see, that at the
same time our adversaries spare not those to whom
they owe allegiance and veneration. Their despair
has pushed them to break those bonds; and it is
observable, that the lower they are driven, the
<span class="pgnm">018</span><a id="page_018" name="page_018"></a>
more violently they write; as Lucifer and his companions
were only proud when angels, but grew
malicious when devils. Let them rail, since it is
the only solace of their miseries, and the only revenge
which, we hope, they now can take. The
greatest and the best of men are above their reach;
and, for our meanness, though they assault us like
footpads in the dark, their blows have done us little
harm: we yet live to justify ourselves in open day,
to vindicate our loyalty to the government, and to
assure your lordship, with all submission and sincerity,
that we are</p>

<p>Footnote</p>
<ol>
<li><a id="Guise_2-1" name="Guise_2-1"></a><p>Lawrence Hyde, created Earl of Rochester in 1682, was the
second son of the famous Lord Clarendon, and affords a rare instance
of the son of a disgraced minister recovering that favour
at court, which had been withdrawn from his father. He was
now at the head of the Commissioners for the Treasury, and a patron
of our poet; as appears from the terms of Dryden's letter, soliciting
his interest in very affecting terms, and from the subsequent
dedication of "Cleomenes," where he acknowledges his lordship's
goodness during the reign of two masters; and that, even from a
bare treasury, his success was contrary to that of Mr Cowley;
Gideon's fleece having been moistened, when all the ground
was dry around it. The Earl of Rochester was the more proper
patron for the "Duke of Guise," as he was a violent opponent of
the bill of exclusion. He was Lord High Treasurer in the reign
of James II., and died in 1711.</p></li>

<li><a id="Guise_2-3" name="Guise_2-3"></a><p>Dryden seems here to allude to the triumphant strain in which
Shadwell mentions the reception of "The Lancashire Witches:"
"I could not imagine," he says, "till I heard that great opposition
was designed against the play a month before it was acted, by
a party who, being ashamed to say it was for the sake of the Irish
priest, pretended that I had written a satire on the Church of England;
and several profest Papists railed at it violently before they
had seen it, alleging that for a reason, such dear friends they are
to our Church: and, notwithstanding all was put out that could
any way be wrested to an offence against the Church, yet they
came with the greatest malice in the world to hiss it; and many,
that called themselves Protestants, joined with them in that noble
enterprise.</p>

<p>"But, for all this, they came resolved to hiss it, right or wrong,
and had gotten mercenary fellows, who were such fools they did
not know when to hiss; and this was evident to all the audience.
It was wonderful to see men of great quality, and gentlemen, in so
mean a combination; but, to my great satisfaction, they came off
as meanly as I could wish. I had so numerous an assembly of the
best sort of men, who stood so generously in my defence for the
three first days, that they quashed all the vain attempts of my enemies;
the inconsiderable party of hissers yielded, and the play
lived in spite of them.</p>

<p>"Had it been never so bad, I had valued the honour of having
so many and such friends as eminently appeared for me, above
that of excelling the most admirable Jonson, if it were possible to
be done by me."</p>

<p>This flourish of exultation contains many things which were
doubtless offensive to Dryden's jealousy of dramatic fame, as well
as to his political principles. Nor was he probably insensible to
the affected praise bestowed on Jonson, whose merit, it was fashionable
to say, he had attempted to depreciate.</p></li>

<li><a id="Guise_2-4" name="Guise_2-4"></a><p>The greater, and, perhaps, the most formidable, part of those
who now opposed the court, were the remnants of the old fanatics,
whose religious principles were shocked by the dissolute manners
of Charles and his courtiers. These, of course, added little to the
force of the party in the theatres, which they never frequented.
Shadwell seems to acknowledge this disadvantage in the epilogue
to "The Lancashire Witches:"</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Our Popes and friars on one side offend,</p>
<p>And yet, alas! the city's not our friend:</p>
<p>The city neither like us nor our wit,</p>
<p>They say their wives learn ogling in the pit;</p>
<p>They're from the boxes taught to make advances,</p>
<p>To answer stolen sighs and naughty glances.</p>
<p>We virtuous ladies some new ways must seek,</p>
<p>For all conspire our playing trade to break.</p>
</div>

<p>But although the citizens declined to frequent even the plays
written on their own side of the question, Armstrong, and the personal
followers of Monmouth, were of a gayer complexion, and
doubtless, as they were not inferior to the courtiers in the licence
assumed by the age, formed the principal part of the audience at
the protestant plays. The discovery of the Rye-house Plot broke
the strength of this part of the confederacy, and the odium attending
that enterprise rendered their opposition to the court in
public assemblies both fruitless and dangerous.</p></li>

found in Lord Shaftesbury's cabinet, and produced on his trial, in
which that memorable engagement seems to be pretty closely copied, was
probably what our poet alludes to.</p></li>

<li><a id="Guise_3-2" name="Guise_3-2"></a><p>The protestant flail was a kind of bludgeon, so jointed as to fold together,
and lie concealed in the pocket. They are supposed to have been invented
to arm the insurgents about this period. In the trial of Braddon and Spoke
for a misdemeanor, the recorder offered to prove, that Braddon had bragged,
that "he was the only inventor of the protestant flails; an instrument you
have heard of, gentlemen, and for what use designed." This circumstance
was not omitted by Jefferies, in his characteristic address to the prisoner.
"But oh what a happiness it was for this sort of people, that they had got
Mr Braddon, an honest man and a man of courage, says Mr Speke, a man
<i>a propos</i>! and pray, says he to his friend, give him the best advice you can,
for he is a man very fit for the purpose; and pray secure him under a sham
name, for I'll undertake there are such designs upon pious Mr Braddon, such
connivances to do him mischief, that, if he had not had his <i>protestant flail</i>
about him, somebody or other would have knocked him on the head; and he
is such a wonderful man, that all the king's courts must needs conspire to do
Mr Braddon a mischief. A very pretty sort of man, upon my word, and he
must be used accordingly." <i>State Trials</i>, Vol. III. p. 897. In one of the
scarce medals struck by James II. Justice is represented weighing mural
crowns, which preponderate against a naked sword, a serpent, and a protestant
flail: on each side of the figure are a head and trunk, representing those of
Argyle and Monmouth. An accurate description of this weapon occurs in
the following passage from Roger North: "There was much recommendation
of silk armour, and the prudence of being provided with it against the
time protestants were to be massacred. And accordingly there were abundance
of these silken backs, breasts, and pots (i.e. head-pieces), made and
sold, that were pretended to be pistol proof; in which any man dressed up
was as safe as in a house, for it was impossible any one could go to strike him
for laughing. So ridiculous was the figure, as they say, of hogs in armour; an
image of derision, insensible but to the view, as I have had it. This was armour
of defence; but our sparks were not altogether so tame as to carry their
provisions no farther, for truly they intended to be assailants upon fair occasion,
and had for that end recommended also to them a certain pocket weapon,
which, for its design and efficacy, had the honour to be called a <i>protestant
flail</i>. It was for street and crowd-work; and the engine lying perdue
in a coat pocket, might readily sally out to execution, and by clearing a great
hall, a piazza, or so, carry an election by a choice way of polling, called
<i>knocking down</i>. The handle resembled a farrier's blood-stick, and the fall
was joined to the end by a strong nervous ligature, that in its swing fell just
short of the hand, and was made of <i>lignum vit&aelig;</i>, or rather, as the poet termed
it, <i>mortis</i>." <i>Examen.</i> p. 572. The following is the first stanza of "The Protestant
Flail; an excellent new song, to the tune of, Lacy's Maggot, or the
Hobby Horse." It is thus labelled by Luttrell: "A bonny thing, 14 June,
1632."</p>

<p>This flail it was made of the finest wood,</p>

to find bills against them, bringing in what are technically called verdicts
of <i>ignoramus</i>. It was here that the whig sheriffs were of most consequence to
their party; for by their means the juries were picked from the very centre of
the faction; and although they included many men of eminence, both for rank
and talents, yet they were generally such as had made up their minds to cast
the bill long before they came into court. This gave great offence to the
royalists. North says, "There lay the barrier of the faction; and that stately
word (<i>ignoramus</i>) became the appellative of the whole corrupt practice, and
the infamous title of all the persons concerned in it." In Luttrell's Collection
I find, "Ignoramus, an excellent new song, to the tune of Lay by your
Pleading, Law lies a Bleeding." 15 Dec. 1681.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Buss.</span> Lights there! more lights! What, burn the tapers dim,<br />

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm">024</span><a id="page_024" name="page_024"></a>
<span class="cnm">Cur.</span> I have been taking godly pains to satisfy some
scruples raised amongst weak brothers of our party,
that were staggering in the cause.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pol.</span> What could they find to object?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cur.</span> They thought, to arm against the king was treason.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Buss.</span> I hope you set them right?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cur.</span> Yes; and for answer, I produced this book.<br />
A Calvinist minister of Orleans<br />
Writ this, to justify the admiral<br />
For taking arms against the king deceased;<br />
Wherein he proves, that irreligious kings<br />
May justly be deposed, and put to death.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Buss.</span> To borrow arguments from heretic books,<br />
Methinks, was not so prudent.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cur.</span> Yes; from the devil, if it would help our cause.<br />
The author was indeed a heretic;<br />
The matter of the book is good and pious.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pol.</span> But one prime article of our Holy League<br />
Is to preserve the king, his power, and person.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cur.</span> That must be said, you know, for decency;<br />
A pretty blind to make the shoot secure.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Buss.</span> But did the primitive Christians e'er rebel,<br />
When under heathen lords? I hope they did.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cur.</span> No sure, they did not; for they had not power;<br />
The conscience of a people is their power.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pol.</span> Well; the next article in our solemn covenant<br />
Has cleared the point again.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Buss.</span> What is't? I should be glad to find the king<br />
No safer than needs must.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pol.</span> That, in case of opposition from any person
whatsoever&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cur.</span> That's well, that well; then the king is not
excepted, if he oppose us.&mdash;</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pol.</span> We are obliged to join as one, to punish<br />
All, who attempt to hinder or disturb us.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm">025</span><a id="page_025" name="page_025"></a>
<span class="cnm">Buss.</span> 'Tis a plain case; the king's included in
the punishment, in case he rebel against the people.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pol.</span> But how can he rebel?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cur.</span> I'll make it out: Rebellion is an insurrection
against the government; but they that have the
power are actually the government; therefore, if the
people have the power, the rebellion is in the king.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Buss.</span> A most convincing argument for faction.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cur.</span> For arming, if you please, but not for faction:<br />
For still the faction is the fewest number:<br />
So what they call the lawful government,<br />
Is now the faction; for the most are ours.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Pol.</span> Since we are proved to be above the king,
I would gladly understand whom we are to obey,
or, whether we are to be all kings together?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cur.</span> Are you a member of the League, and ask
that question? There's an article, that, I may say,
is as necessary as any in the creed; namely, that
we, the said associates, are sworn to yield ready
obedience, and faithful service, to that head which
shall be deputed.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Buss.</span> 'Tis most manifest, that, by virtue of our
oath, we are all subjects to the Duke of Guise. The
king's an officer that has betrayed his trust; and
therefore we have turned him out of service.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Omn.</span> Agreed, agreed.</p>

<p class="sdn">Enter the Duke of <span class="cnm">Guise,</span> Cardinal of <span class="cnm">Guise,</span>

Lieutenant-general, chief, or constable,<br />
Good decent names, that only mean&mdash;your slave.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Buss.</span> You chased the Germans hence, exiled Navarre,<br />
And rescued France from heretics and strangers.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Aum.</span> What he, and all of us have done, is known.<br />
What's our reward? Our offices are lost,<br />
Turned out, like laboured oxen after harvest,<br />
To the bare commons of the withered field.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Buss.</span> Our charters will go next; because we sheriffs<br />
Permit no justice to be done on those<br />
The court calls rebels, but we call them saints.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gui.</span> Yes; we are all involved, as heads, or parties;<br />
Dipt in the noisy crime of state, called treason;<br />
And traitors we must be, to king, or country.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cur.</span> I hope well, my lord.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Card.</span> That is, he hopes you mean to make him abbot,<br />
And he deserves your care of his preferment;<br />
For all his prayers are curses on the government,<br />
And all his sermons libels on the king;<br />
In short, a pious, hearty, factious priest.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gui.</span> All that are here, my friends, shall share my fortunes:<br />
There's spoil, preferments, wealth enough in France;<br />
'Tis but deserve, and have. The Spanish king<br />
Consigns me fifty thousand crowns a-week<br />
To raise, and to foment a civil war.<br />
'Tis true, a pension, from a foreign prince,<br />
<span class="pgnm">027</span><a id="page_027" name="page_027"></a>
Sounds treason in the letter of the law,<br />
But good intentions justify the deed.</p>

No matter whence it comes.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Buss.</span> Our city-bands are twenty thousand strong,<br />
Well-disciplined, well-armed, well-seasoned traitors,<br />
Thick-rinded heads, that leave no room for kernel;<br />
Shop-consciences, of proof against an oath,<br />
Preached up, and ready tined for a rebellion<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_4-1">[1]</a>.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gui.</span> Why then the noble plot is fit for birth;<br />
And labouring France cries out for midwife hands.<br />
We missed surprising of the king at Blois,<br />
When last the states were held: 'twas oversight;<br />
Beware we make not such another blot.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Card.</span> This holy time of Lent we have him sure;<br />
He goes unguarded, mixed with whipping friars.<br />
In that procession, he's more fit for heaven:<br />
What hinders us to seize the royal penitent,<br />
And close him in a cloister?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Cur.</span> Or dispatch him; I love to make all sure.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gui.</span> No; guard him safe;<br />
Thin diet will do well; 'twill starve him into reason,<br />
'Till he exclude his brother of Navarre,<br />
And graft succession on a worthier choice.<br />
To favour this, five hundred men in arms<br />
Shall stand prepared, to enter at your call,<br />
And speed the work; St Martin's gate was named;<br />
But the sheriff Conty, who commands that ward,<br />
Refused me passage there.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Buss.</span> I know that Conty;<br />

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mel.</span> Hold, hold, a little, fellow citizens; and you,
<span class="pgnm">083</span><a id="page_083" name="page_083"></a>
gentlemen of the rabble, a word of godly exhortation
to strengthen your hands, ere you give the onset.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">1 Cit.</span> Is this a time to make sermons? I would
not hear the devil now, though he should come in
God's name, to preach peace to us.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">2 Cit.</span> Look you, gentlemen, sermons are not to
be despised; we have all profited by godly sermons
that promote sedition: let the precious man hold
forth.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Omn.</span> Let him hold forth, let him hold forth.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mel.</span> To promote sedition is my business: It has
been so before any of you were born, and will be
so, when you are all dead and damned; I have led
on the rabble in all ages.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">1 Cit.</span> That's a lie, and a loud one.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">2 Cit.</span> He has led the rabble both old and young,
that's all ages: A heavenly sweet man, I warrant
him; I have seen him somewhere in a pulpit.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mel.</span> I have sown rebellion every where.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">1 Cit.</span> How, every where? That's another lie:
How far have you travelled, friend?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mel.</span> Over all the world.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">1 Cit.</span> Now, that's a rapper.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">2 Cit.</span> I say no: For, look you, gentlemen, if he
has been a traveller, he certainly says true, for he
may lie by authority.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mel.</span> That the rabble may depose their prince,
has in all times, and in all countries, been accounted
lawful.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">1 Cit.</span> That's the first true syllable he has uttered:
but as how, and whereby, and when, may they
depose him?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mel.</span> Whenever they have more power to depose,
than he has to oppose; and this they may do
upon the least occasion.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">1 Cit.</span> Sirrah, you mince the matter; you should
<span class="pgnm">084</span><a id="page_084" name="page_084"></a>

the better.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mel.</span> [<span class="sdm">Aside.</span>] Here's a rogue now, will out-shoot
the devil in his own bow.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">2 Cit.</span> Some occasion, in my mind, were not
amiss: for, look you, gentlemen, if we have no occasion,
then whereby we have no occasion to depose
him; and therefore, either religion or liberty,
I stick to those occasions; for when they are gone,
good night to godliness and freedom.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mel.</span> When the most are of one side, as that's
our case, we are always in the right; for they, that
are in power, will ever be the judges: so that if we
say white is black, poor white must lose the cause,
and put on mourning; for white is but a single syllable,
and we are a whole sentence. Therefore, go
on boldly, and lay on resolutely for your Solemn
League and Covenant; and if here be any squeamish
conscience who fears to fight against the king,&mdash;though
I, that have known you, citizens, these
thousand years, suspect not any,&mdash;let such understand
that his majesty's politic capacity is to be
distinguished from his natural; and though you
murder him in one, you may preserve him in the
other; and so much for this time, because the enemy
is at hand.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">2 Cit.</span> [<span class="sdm">Looking out.</span>] Look you, gentlemen, 'tis

SCENE I.&mdash;<i>The Castle of Blois.</i></h4>

<p class="sdn"><i>Enter</i> GRILLON, <i>and</i> ALPHONSO CORSO.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gril.</span> Welcome, colonel, welcome to Blois.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alph.</span> Since last we parted at the barricadoes,<br />
The world's turned upside down.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gril.</span> No, 'faith, 'tis better now, 'tis downside up:<br />
Our part o'the wheel is rising, though but slowly.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alph.</span> Who looked for an assembly of the States?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gril.</span> When the king was escaped from Paris,
and got out of the toils, 'twas time for the Guise
to take them down, and pitch others: that is, to
treat for the calling of a parliament, where, being
sure of the major part, he might get by law what
he had missed by force.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alph.</span> But why should the king assemble the
States, to satisfy the Guise, after so many affronts?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gril.</span> For the same reason, that a man in a duel
says he has received satisfaction, when he is first
wounded, and afterwards disarmed.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alph.</span> But why this parliament at Blois, and not
at Paris?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gril.</span> Because no barricadoes have been made at
Blois. This Blois is a very little town, and the king
can draw it after him; but Paris is a damned unwieldy
bulk; and when the preachers draw against
the king, a parson in a pulpit is a devilish fore-horse.
Besides, I found in that insurrection what
dangerous beasts these townsmen are; I tell you,
colonel, a man had better deal with ten of their
wives, than with one zealous citizen: O your inspired
cuckold is most implacable.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alph.</span> Is there any seeming kindness between
the king and the duke of Guise?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm">093</span><a id="page_093" name="page_093"></a>
<span class="cnm">Gril.</span> Yes, most wonderful: they are as dear to
one another as an old usurer, and a rich young heir
upon a mortgage. The king is very loyal to the
Guise, and the Guise is very gracious to the king:
Then the cardinal of Guise, and the archbishop of
Lyons, are the two pendants that are always hanging
at the royal ear; they ease his majesty of all
the spiritual business, and the Guise of all the temporal;
so that the king is certainly the happiest
prince in Christendom, without any care upon him;
so yielding up every thing to his loyal subjects,
that he's infallibly in the way of being the greatest
and most glorious king in all the world.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alph.</span> Yet I have heard he made a sharp reflecting
speech upon their party at the opening of the
parliament, admonished men of their duties, pardoned
what was past, but seemed to threaten vengeance
if they persisted for the future.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gril.</span> Yes; and then they all took the sacrament
together: he promising to unite himself to them,
and they to obey him, according to the laws; yet
the very next morning they went on, in pursuance
of their old commonwealth designs, as violently as
ever.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alph.</span> Now, I am dull enough to think they have
broken their oath.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Gril.</span> Ay, but you are but one private man, and
they are the three States; and if they vote that
they have not broken their oaths, who is to be
judge?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Alph.</span> There's one above.</p>

of Alva, as expressed in the text, is almost literally versified
from Davila's account of the conference. "<i>Il Duca D'Alva,

<p class=""><i>"Entr&ograve; il Duca di Guisa in Parigi il Luned&igrave; nono giorno di
Maggio, ch' era gia vicino il mezzogiorno, non con maggior comitiva
che di sette cavalli tra gentiluomini e servitori: ma come
una piccolo palla di neve, che discende dall' erto si va tanto ingrossando,
che nel fine diviene quasi una montagna eminente; cos&igrave; abandonando
il popolo le case e le botteghe, con plauso e con allegrezza,
per seguitarlo, non fu a mezzo la citt&agrave;, che aveva dietro pi&ugrave; di trentamila
persone, ed era tanta la calca, che a pena egli medesimo poteva
seguitare la sua strada. Andavan le grida del popolo insino
al cielo, n&egrave; mai fu con tanto plauso gridato, "Vita il Re" con
quanto ora si gridava "Vita Guisa." Chi lo sulutava, chi lo
ringraziava, chi se gl' inchinava, chi gli baciava le falde de' vestimenti,
chi, non potendo accostarsi, con le mani e con i gesti di
tutto il corpo dava segui profusi d' allegrezza; e furono veduti
di quelli che, adorandolo come santo, lo toccavano con le corone, e
le medesime poi o baciavano, o con esse si toccavano gli occhi e la
fronte; e sino le donne dalle finestra, spargendo fiori e fronde, onoravano
e benedicevano la sua venuta. Egli all' incontro, con viso
popolare e con faccia ridente, altri accarezzava con le parole, altri
risalutava con i gesti, altri rallegrava con l' occhio, e traversando
le caterve del popolo con la testa scoperta, non permetteva cosa alcuna,
che fosse a proposito per finire a conciliarsi la benevolenza
e l' applauso popolare. In questa maniera, senza fermarsi alla sua
casa, and&ograve; a dirittura a smontare a Sant' Eustachio al palazzo
della Reina Madre, la quale mezza attonita per il suo venire improvviso;
perch&egrave; Monsignor di Bellieure arrivato tre ore innanzi
aveva posto in dubbio la sua venuta; lo ricev&egrave; pallida nel volto,
tutta tremante e contra l' ordinario costume della natura sua
quasi smarrita. Le dimostrazioni del Duca di Guisa furono
piene d' affettuosa umilt&agrave; e di profonda sommissione: le parole
della Reina ambigue, dicendoli; che lo vedeva volentieri, ma che
molto pi&ugrave; volontieri l' arebbe veduto in altro tempo; alla quale
egli rispose con sembiante modestissimo ma con parole altiere:
Ch' egli era buon servitore del Re, e che avendo intese le
calunnie date all' innocenza sua, e le cose che si trattavano contra
la religione e contra gli uomini dabbene di quel popolo, era venuto, o
per divertire il male, e espurgarese stesso, ovvero per lasciar la vita
in servizio di Santa Chiesa e della salute universale. La Reina, interrotto
il ragionamento, mentre egli salutava, come &egrave; solito, le altre
Dame della corte, chiam&ograve; Luigi Davila suo Gentiluomo d' onore,
e gli commise, che facesse intendere al Re, ch' era arrivato il Duca
di Guisa, e ch' ella fra poco l' arebbe condotto al Lovero personalmente.
Si commosse di maniera il Re, ch' era nel suo gabinetto con
Monsignore di Villaclera, con Bellieure e con l' abbate del Bene,
che fu costretto appogiarsi col braccio, coprendosi la faccia, al tavolino,
e interrogato il Davila d' ogni particolare, gli command&ograve;,
che dicesse segretamente alla Reina, che framettesse pi&ugrave; tempo che
fosse possibile alla venuta. L' Abbate del Bene e il Colonello Alfonso
Corso, il quale entr&ograve; in questo punto nel gabinetto, e era confidentissimo,
servitore del Re, e pieno di merito verso la corona, lo
consigliavano, che ricevendo il Duca di Guisa nel medesimo gabinetto,
lo facese uccidere subito nell' istesso luogo, dicendo l' abbate questo</i>
Percutiam pastorem, et dispergentur oves<i>. Ma Villaclera, Bellieure,
e il gran Cancelliere che sopravvenne, furono di contrario
parere allegando esesr tanta la commozione del popolo, che in caso tale,
sprezzando la Maest&agrave; regia, e rompendo tutti i vincoli delle leggi,
sarebbe corso a precipitosa vendetta, e che non essendo le cose
ancora apparecchiate per la difesa propria, e per frenare il furore
della citt&agrave; le forze de' Parigini erano troppo poderose parole per
stuzzicarle."</i> Lib. ix.</p></li>

<li><a id="Guise_4-14" name="Guise_4-14"></a><p>For this scene also, which gave great offence to the followers
of Monmouth, our author had the authority of Davila in the continuation
of the passage already quoted.</p>

<p><i>"Mentre il Re sta dubbioso nell' animo, sopraggiunse la Reina,
che conduceva il Duca di Guisa essendo venuta nella sua seggetta,
e il Duca accompagnatala sempre a piedi; ma con tanto seguito e
frequenza di gente, che tutta la Citt&agrave; pareva ridotta nel giro del
cortile del Lovero e nelle strade vicine. Traversarono fra la spalliera
de' soldati, essendo presente Monsignor di Griglione maestro
di campo della guardia, il quale uomo libero e militare, e poco
amico del Duca di Guisa, mentre egli s' inchina ad ogni privato soldato,
fece pochissimo sembiante di riverirlo, il che da lui fu con
qualche pallidezza del volto ben osservato, la quale continu&ograve; maggiormente,
poich&egrave; vide gli Suizzeri far spalliera con l'arme a piedi
della scala, e nella sala gli arcieri, e nelle camere i gentiluomini
tutti radunati per aspettarlo. Entrarono nella camera del Re, il
quale mentre il Duca di Guisa con profonda riverenza se gl' inchin&ograve;,
con viso scorrucciato gli disse; Io v' avevo fatto intendere, che non
veniste. A queste parole il Duca con l' istessa sommissione, che
aveva fatto alla Reina, ma con parole pi&ugrave; ritenute, rispose. Ch'
Egli era venuto a mettersi nelle braccia della giustitia di Sua Maest&agrave;,
per iscolparsi delle calunnie, che gli erano apposte da' suoi nemici, e
che nondimeno non sarebbe venuto, quando gli fosse stato detto chiaramente,
che Sua Maest&agrave; comandata, che non venisse. Il Re rivolto
a Bellieure, alteratamente lo domand&ograve; s' era vero, che gli avesse
data commissione di dire al Duca di Guisa, che non venisse, se non
voleva esser tenuto per autore delli scandali, e delle sollevazioni de'
Parigini. Monseignor di Bellieure si feceinnanzi, e volle render conto
dell' ambasciata sua; ma nel principio del parlare, il Re l' interruppe,
dicendogli, che bastava, e rivolto al Duca di Guisa disse; che
non sapeva, ch' egii fosse stato calunniato da persona alcuna, ma che
la sua innocenza sarebbe apparsa chiara, quando dalla sua venuta
non fosse nata alcuna novit&agrave;, e interrotta la quiete del governo,
come si prevedeva. La Reina pratica della natura del Re, conoscendolo
dalla faccia inclinato a qualche gagliarda risoluzione, lo tir&ograve;
da parte, e gli disse in sostanza quel che aveva veduto della concorrenza
del popolo, e che non pensasse a deliberazioni precipitose, perch&egrave;
non era tempo. Il medesimo soggiunse la Duchessa d' Uzes, che
gli era vicina, e il Duca di Guisa osservando attentamente ogni minuzia,
come vide questa  fluttazione, per non dar tempo al Re di
deliberare, si finse stracco dal viaggio, e licenziandosi brevemente da
lui, accompagnato dall' istessa frequenza di popolo, ma da niuno di
quelli della corte, si ritir&ograve; nella strada di Sant' Antonio alle sue
case."</i> Lib. ix.</p></li>

<li><a id="Guise_4-18" name="Guise_4-18"></a><p>It was a frequent complaint of the tories at this period, that
the commons, in zeal for their own privileges and immunities,
were apt sometimes to infringe the personal liberties of the subject.
This is set forth with some humour in a political pamphlet
of the day, called, "A Dialogue betwixt Sam, the ferryman of
Datchet, Will, a waterman of London, and Tom, a bargeman of
Oxford;" upon the king's calling a parliament to meet at Oxford,
London, 1681. "As to their own members, they turned them
out, and took others in at their will and pleasure; and if they
made any fault, they expelled them; and wherever any stood in
competition for any town, him they knew would give his vote
along with them was admitted, right or wrong. And then they
terrified all the sheriffs, mayors, and bailiffs in the kingdom, besides
abundance of gentlemen and other honest countrymen. For,
on the least complaint of any man's misdemeanour, or information
from any member, immediately a serjeant at arms was sent for
them, and so much a mile and hour paid, and down on their marrowbones
to their worships, and a sound scolding from Mr Speaker,
or else to the Tower or Gatehouse they went. The king, God bless
him, never took a quarter of that state on him they did ... It
was brought to that pass, that two footboys, boxing one day in the
Palace-yard, he that was beaten proved to belong to a member,
and told the other boy, if he knew his master, he would cause him
to be sent for in custody, for keeping such a rogue as he was, that
had committed a breach of privilege in beating a member's servant.
The boy replied, if it would do him any kindness, he would
beat him again, and tell him his master's name into the bargain;
and would lay him a crown, that, though his master should bid
the Speaker, and all the House of Commons, kiss, &amp;c, they durst
not send a serjeant at arms for him. The beaten boy, much nettled
at his speech, laid down his money, as the other did: now,
said the boy, my master is the king of France, and I am come
over with some of his servants to fetch horses out of England;
go, bid thy master and the House of Commons send a serjeant at
arms to fetch him over.&mdash;<i>Sam.</i> Before my heart it was a good answer;
I hope he won his monies?&mdash;<i>Will.</i> So he did; but it was
put into a waterman's hands, and when it was demanded, says the
beaten boy, Sirrah, give it him, if you dare; if his master be the
king of France, I'll make you answer it before the House of Commons.
The waterman durst do no other, but gave either their
own monies. There's no contending with parliament men, or parliament
men's men, nor boys."</p>

<p>Some occasion was given for these reproaches by the summary
and arbitrary commitment of many individuals, who had addressed
the king in terms expressing their abhorrence of the vehement
petitions presented by the other party for the sitting of parliament,
and were thence distinguished by the name of Abhorrers. This
course was ended by the sturdy resistance of one Stowell, who
had, as foreman of the grand jury at Exeter, presented an <i>abhorring</i>
address to the king. A serjeant at arms having been sent to
apprehend him, he refused to submit, and bid the officer take his
course, adding, he knew no law which made him accountable for
what he did as a grand juryman. The House were so much embarrassed
by his obstinacy, that they hushed up the matter by
voting that he was indisposed, and adjourning the debate <i>sine dic.</i></p></li>

to have been brought on the stage, in a nobler strain, and free from
the buffoonery, by which the veteran's character is degraded. It
is thus told by Davila: <i>"Trattandosi delle persone, che avessero
da eseguire il fatto, il Re elesse di fidarsene nel Maestro di campo

nemico del Duca di Guisa. Fattolo perci&ograve; venire, gli espose
con accomodate parole il suo pensiero, e gli signific&ograve; aver disegnato,

vuoles ch' io vada a sfidare il Duca di Guisa, e che mi ammazzi a corpo

serva di manigoldo, mentre la giustizia sua determina di farlo morire,
questo non si conviene a par mio, n&egrave; sono per farlo giammai. Il Re

timore alcuno, e per&ograve; replic&ograve;; che gli bastava, che tenesse segreta
questo pensiero, perch&egrave; non l' aveva communicato ad alcun altro, e
divulgandosi egli sarebbe stato colpevole d' averlo palesato. A
questo rispose Griglione: Essere servitore di fede, d' onore, n&egrave;

Re grandemente dubbioso di quello dovesse operare.</i>" Lib. ix.</p></li>

<h3 class="chap">VINDICATION OF THE DUKE OF GUISE.</h3>

<p>It was easy to foresee, that a play, which professed to be a
<i>broadside</i> discharged at the whole popular party, would not long
remain uncensured. The satire being derived from a historical
parallel of some delicacy, offered certain facilities of attack to the
critics. It was only stretching the resemblance beyond the
bounds to which Dryden had limited it, and the comparison
became odious, if not dangerous. The whig writers did not neglect
this obvious mode of attack, now rendered more popular by
the encroachment lately attempted by the court upon the freedom
of the city, whose magistrates had been exposed to ridicule
in the play.</p>

<p>Our readers cannot but remember, that, in order to break the
spirit of the city of London, a writ of <i>quo warranto</i> was issued
against the incorporation, by which was instituted a vexatious and
captious inquiry into the validity of the charter of London. The
purpose of this process was to compel the city to resign their freedom
and immunities into the king's hands, and to receive a new
grant of them, so limited, as might be consistent with the views
of the crown, or otherwise to declare them forfeited. One Thomas
Hunt, a lawyer of some eminence, who had been solicitor for
the Viscount Stafford when that unfortunate nobleman was tried
for high treason, and had written upon the side of the tories, but
had now altered his principles, stepped forward upon this occasion
as the champion of the immunities of the city of London<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_6-1">[1]</a>.
<span class="pgnm">128</span><a id="page_128" name="page_128"></a>
The ludicrous light in which the sheriffs are placed, during the
scene with Grillon in the third act, gave great offence to this active
partizan; and he gives vent to his displeasure in the following
attack upon the author, and the performance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"They have already condemned the charter and city, and have
executed the magistrates in effigy upon the stage, in a play called
"The Duke of Guise," frequently acted and applauded; intended
most certainly, to provoke the rabble into tumults and disorder.
The Roman priest had no success, (God be thanked,) when
he animated the people not to suffer the same sheriffs to be carried
through the city to the Tower, prisoners. Now the poet hath
undertaken, for their being kicked three or four times a-week
about the stage to the gallows, infamously rogued and rascalled,
to try what he can do towards making the charter forfeitable, by
some extravagancy and disorder of the people, which the authority
of the best governed cities have not been able to prevent, sometimes
under far less provocations.</p>

<p>"But this ought not to move the citizens, when he hath so maliciously
and mischievously represented the king, and the king's
son, nay, and his favourite the duke too, to whom he gives the
worst strokes of his unlucky fancy.</p>

<p>"He puts the king under the person of Henry III. of France,
who appeared in the head of the <i>Parisian</i> massacre; the king's
son under the person of the Duke of Guise, who concerted it
with the Queen-mother of France, and was slain in that very place,
by the righteous judgment of God, where he and his mother had
first contrived it.</p>

<p>"The Duke of Guise ought to have represented a great prince,
that had inserved to some most detestable villany, to please the
rage, or lust, of a tyrant.</p>

<p>"Such great courtiers have been often sacrificed, to appease
the furies of the tyrant's guilty conscience, to expiate for his sin,
and to atone the people.</p>

<p><span class="pgnm">129</span><a id="page_129" name="page_129"></a>
"Besides, that a tyrant naturally stands in fear of ministers of
mighty wickedness; he is always obnoxious to them, he is a slave
to them, as long as they live they remember him of his guilt, and
awe him. These wicked slaves become most imperious masters:
they drag him to greater evils for their own impunity, than they
first perpetrated for his pleasure, and their own ambition.</p>

<p>"But such are best given up to public justice, but by no means
to be assassinated. Until this age, never before was an assassination
invited, commended, and encouraged upon a public theatre.</p>

<p>"It is no wonder that <i>Trimmers</i> (so they call men of some moderation
of that party) displease them; for they seem to have designs
for which it behoves them to know their men; they must be
perfectly wicked, or perfectly deceived; of the Catiline make;
bold, and without understanding; that can adhere to men that
publicly profess murders, and applaud the design.</p>

<p>"Caius C&aelig;sar (to give unto C&aelig;sar the things that are C&aelig;sar's)
was in the Catiline conspiracy; and then the word was, <i>he that is
not for us is against us;</i> for the instruments of wickedness must
be men that are resolute and forward, and without consideration;
or they will deceive the design, and relent when they enterprize.</p>

<p>"But when he was made dictator, and had some pretences,
and a probability by means less wicked and mischievous to arrive
at the government, his words were, <i>he that is not against us is
with us.</i> But to Pompey only it belonged, and to his cause, or
the like cause, to the defenders of ancient established governments,
of the English monarchy and liberties, to say, they that
are not with us are against us. <i>In internecino bello,</i> in attacks upon
government, <i>medii pro hostibus habentur,</i> neutral men are traitors,
and assist, by their indifferency, to the destruction of the government.
As many as applaud this play, ought to be put under
sureties of the peace; and yet not one warrant, that we hear of
yet, granted by the Lord Chief Justice.</p>

<p>"But it is not a Duke of Guise to be assassinated, a turbulent,
wicked, and haughty courtier; but an innocent and gentle prince,
as well as brave, and renowned for noble achievements: a prince,
that hath no fault, but that he is the king's son; and the best too
of all his sons; such a son, as would have made the best of emperors
happy.</p>

<p>"Except it be, that the people honour him and love him, and
every where publicly and loudly show it: But this they do, for
that the best people of England have no other way left to show
their loyalty to the king, and love to their religion and government,
in long intervals of Parliament, than by prosecuting his son,
for the sake of the king and his own merit, with all the demonstrations
of the highest esteem.</p>

<p><span class="pgnm">130</span><a id="page_130" name="page_130"></a>
"But he hath not used his patron Duke much better; for he
hath put him under a most dismal and unfortunate character of a
successor, excluded from the crown by act of state for his religion,
who fought his way to the crown, changed his religion, and
died by the hand of a Roman assassinate.</p>

<p>"It is enough to make his great duke's courage quail, to find
himself under such an unlucky and disastrous representation, and
thus personated; besides, he hath offered a justification of an act
of exclusion against a popish successor, in a Protestant kingdom,
by remembering what was done against the king of Navarre.</p>

<p>"The Popish religion, in France, did, <i>de facto,</i> by act of state,
exclude a Protestant prince, who is under no obligation, from his
religion, to destroy his Popish subjects.</p>

<p>"Though a Popish prince is, to destroy his Protestant subjects.</p>

<p>"A Popish prince, to a Protestant kingdom, without more,
must be the most insufferable tyrant, and exceed the character
that any story can furnish for that sort of monster: And yet all
the while to himself a religious and an applauded prince; discharged
from the tortures that ordinarily tear and rend the hearts of
the most cruel princes, and make them as uneasy to themselves as
they are to their subjects, and sometimes prevail so far as to lay
some restraints upon their wicked minds.</p>

<p>"But this his patron will impute to his want of judgment; for
this poet's heroes are commonly such monsters as Theseus and
Hercules are, renowned throughout all ages for destroying.</p>

<p>"But to excuse him, this man hath forsaken his post, and entered
upon another province. To "The Observator"<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_6-2">[2]</a> it belongs
to confound truth and falsehood; and, by his false colours and
impostures, to put out the eyes of the people, and leave them
without understanding.</p>

<p>"But our poet hath not so much art left him as to frame any
thing agreeable, or <i>verisimilar</i>, to amuse the people, or wherewith
to deceive them.</p>

<p>"His province is to corrupt the manners of the nation, and
lay waste their morals; his understanding is clapt, and his brains
are vitiated, and he is to rot the age.</p>

<p>"His endeavours are more happily applied, to extinguish the
little remains of the virtue of the age by bold impieties, and befooling
religion by impious and inept rhymes, to confound virtue
and vice, good and evil, and leave us without consciences.</p>

<p>"And thus we are prepared for destruction.</p>

<p><span class="pgnm">131</span><a id="page_131" name="page_131"></a>
"But to give the world a taste of his atheism and impiety, I
shall recite two of his verses, as recited upon the stage, viz.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>For conscience, and heaven's fear, religious rules,</p>
<p>They are all state-bells to toll in pious fools;</p>
</div>

<p>which I have done the rather, that some honest judge, or justice,
may direct a process against this bold impious man; or some honest
surrogate, or official, may find leisure to proceed, <i>ex officio,</i>
against him, notwithstanding at present they are so encumbered
with the dissenters.</p>

<p>"Such public blasphemies against religion, never were unpunished
in any country, or age, but this.</p>

<p>"But I have made too long a digression, but that it carries
with it some instructions towards the preserving of the honour of
your august city, viz.</p>

<p>"That you do not hereafter authorise the stage to expose and
revile your great officers, and offices, by the indignities yourselves
do them; whilst the Papists clap their hands, and triumph at
your public disgraces, and in the hopes they conceive thereby of
the ruin of your government, as if that were as sure and certain to
them, as it is to us, without doubt, that they once fired it.</p>

<p>"And further, for that it was fit to set forth to the world, of
what spirit our enemies are, how they intend to attack us; as also,
how bold they are with his majesty, what false and dishonourable
representations they make of him, and present to the world
upon a public theatre; which, I must confess, hath moved me
with some passion."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This angry barrister was not the only adversary whom Dryden
had to encounter on this occasion. Thomas Shadwell, a man of
some talents for comedy, and who professed to tread in the footsteps
of Ben Jonson, had for some time been at variance with Dryden
and Otway. He was probably the author of a poem, entitled,
"A Lenten Prologue, refused by the Players;" which is marked
by Mr Luttrel, 11th April, 1683, and contains the following direct
attack on "The Duke of Guise," and the author:</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>A more formal attack was made in a pamphlet, entitled, "Some
Reflections on the pretended parallel in the Play called the Duke
of Guise." This Dryden, in the following Vindication, supposes
to have been sketched by Shadwell, and finished by a gentleman
of the Temple<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_6-4">[4]</a>. In these Reflections, the obvious ground of attack,
<span class="pgnm">133</span><a id="page_133" name="page_133"></a>
occupied by Hunt, is again resumed. The general indecency
of a theatrical exhibition, which alluded to state-transactions of a
grave and most important nature; the indecorum of comparing
the king to such a monarch as Henry III., infamous for treachery,
cruelty, and vices of the most profligate nature; above all, the
parallel betwixt the Dukes of Monmouth and Guise, by which the
former is exhibited as a traitor to his father, and recommended as
no improper object for assassination&mdash;are topics insisted on at some
length, and with great vehemence.</p>

<p>Our author was not insensible to these attacks, by which his
loyalty to the king, and the decency of his conduct towards Monmouth,
the king's offending, but still beloved, son, and once Dryden's
own patron, stood painfully compromised. Accordingly, shortly
after these pamphlets had appeared, the following advertisement
was annexed to "The Duke of Guise:"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"There was a preface intended to this play in vindication of it,
against two scurrilous libels lately printed; but it was judged, that
a defence of this nature would require more room than a preface
reasonably could allow. For this cause, and for the importunities
of the stationers, who hastened their impression, it is deferred
for some little time, and will be printed by itself. Most men are
already of opinion, that neither of the pamphlets deserve an answer,
because they are stuffed with open falsities, and sometimes
contradict each other; but, for once, they shall have a day or
two thrown away upon them, though I break an old custom for
their sakes, which was,&mdash;to scorn them."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The resolution, thus announced, did not give universal satisfaction
to our author's friends; one of whom published the following
remonstrance, which contains some good sense, in very indifferent
poetry:</p>

<p style="text-indent: -1em; margin-left: 1em;"><i>An Epode to his worthy Friend</i> <span class="smcap">John Dryden,</span> <i>to advise him

<h3 class="chap">THE
VINDICATION
OF<br />
THE DUKE OF GUISE.</h3>

<p>In the year of his majesty's happy Restoration,
the first play I undertook was the "Duke of Guise;"
as the fairest way, which the Act of Indemnity had
then left us, of setting forth the rise of the late rebellion;
and by exploding the villainies of it upon
the stage, to precaution posterity against the like
errors.</p>

<p>As this was my first essay, so it met with the
fortune of an unfinished piece; that is to say, it was
damned in private, by the advice of some friends to
whom I shewed it; who freely told me, that it was
an excellent subject; but not so artificially wrought,
as they could have wished; and now let my enemies
make their best of this confession.</p>

<p>The scene of the Duke of Guise's return to Paris,
against the king's positive command, was then
written. I have the copy of it still by me, almost
the same which it now remains, being taken verbatim
out of Davila; for where the action is remarkable,
and the very words related, the poet is not at
liberty to change them much; and if he will be adding
<span class="pgnm">138</span><a id="page_138" name="page_138"></a>
any thing for ornament, it ought to be wholly
of a piece. This do I take for a sufficient justification
of that scene, unless they will make the pretended
parallel to be a prophecy, as well as a parallel
of accidents, that were twenty years after to
come.<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-1">[1]</a> Neither do I find, that they can suggest
the least colour for it in any other part of the tragedy.</p>

<p>But now comes the main objection,&mdash;why was it
stopt then? To which I shall render this just account,
with all due respects to those who were the
occasion of it.</p>

<p>Upon a wandering rumour (which I will divide
betwixt malice and mistake) that some great persons
were represented, or personated in it, the matter
was complained of to my Lord Chamberlain;
who, thereupon, appointed the play to be brought
to him, and prohibited the acting of it until further
order; commanding me, after this, to wait upon his
lordship; which I did, and humbly desired him to
compare the play with the history, from whence
the subject was taken, referring to the first scene of
the fourth act, whereupon the exception was grounded,
and leaving Davila (the original) with his lordship.
This was before midsummer; and about two
months after, I received the play back again from
his lordship, but without any positive order whether
it should be acted or not; neither was Mr Lee, or
myself, any way solicitous about it. But this indeed
<span class="pgnm">139</span><a id="page_139" name="page_139"></a>
I ever said, that it was intended for the king's
service; and his majesty was the best judge, whether
it answered that end or no; and that I reckoned
it my duty to submit, if his majesty, for any reason
whatsoever, should deem it unfit for the stage.
In the interim, a strict scrutiny was made, and no
parallel of the great person designed, could be made
out. But this push failing, there were immediately
started some terrible insinuations, that the person
of his majesty was represented under that of
Henry the Third; which if they could have found
out, would have concluded, perchance, not only in
the stopping of the play, but in the hanging up of
the poets. But so it was, that his majesty's wisdom
and justice acquitted both the one, and the
other; and when the play itself was almost forgotten,
there were orders given for the acting of it.</p>

<p>This is matter of fact; and I have the honour of
so great witnesses to the truth of what I have delivered,
that it will need no other appeal. As to
the exposing of any person living, our innocency is
so clear, that it is almost unnecessary to say, it was
not in my thought; and, as far as any one man can
vouch for another, I do believe it was as little in
Mr Lee's. And now since some people have been
so busy as to cast out false and scandalous surmises,
how far we two agreed upon the writing of it, I
must do a common right both to Mr Lee and myself,
to declare publicly, that it was at his earnest
desire, without any solicitation of mine, that this
play was produced betwixt us. After the writing
of &OElig;dipus, I passed a promise to join with him in
another; and he happened to claim the performance
of that promise, just upon the finishing of a poem,<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-2">[2]</a>
<span class="pgnm">140</span><a id="page_140" name="page_140"></a>
when I would have been glad of a little respite before
the undertaking of a second task. The person,
that passed betwixt us, knows this to be true;
and Mr Lee himself, I am sure, will not disown it;
So that I did not "seduce him to join with me," as
the malicious authors of the Reflections are pleased
to call it; but Mr Lee's loyalty is above so ridiculous
a slander. I know very well, that the town
did ignorantly call and take this to be my play;
but I shall not arrogate to myself the merits of my
friend. Two-thirds of it belonged to him; and to
me only the first scene of the play; the whole fourth
act, and the first half, or somewhat more, of the fifth.</p>

<p>The pamphleteers, I know, do very boldly insinuate,
that, "before the acting of it, I took the whole
play to myself; but finding afterwards how ill success
it had upon the stage, I threw as much of it as
possibly I could upon my fellow." Now here are
three damned lies crowded together into a very little
room; first, that I assumed any part of it to myself,
which I had not written; wherein I appeal,
not only to my particular acquaintance, but to the
whole company of actors, who will witness for me,
that, in all the rehearsals, I never pretended to any
one scene of Mr Lee's, but did him all imaginable
right, in his title to the greater part of it. I hope
I may, without vanity, affirm to the world, that I
never stood in need of borrowing another man's reputation;
and I have been as little guilty of the injustice,
of laying claim to any thing which was not
my own. Nay, I durst almost refer myself to some
of the angry poets on the other side, whether I have
not rather countenanced and assisted their beginnings,
than hindered them from rising.<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-3">[3]</a> The two
<span class="pgnm">141</span><a id="page_141" name="page_141"></a>
other falsities are, the "ill success of the play," and
"my disowning it." The former is manifestly without
foundation; for it succeeded beyond my very
hopes, having been frequently acted, and never
without a considerable audience; and then it is a
thousand to one, that, having no ground to disown
it, I did not disown it; but the universe to a nutshell
that I did not disown it for want of success,
when it succeeded so much beyond my expectation.
But my malignant adversaries are the more excusable
for this coarse method of breaking in upon truth
and good manners, because it is the only way they
have to gratify the genius and the interest of the
faction together; and never so much pains taken
neither, to so very, very little purpose. They decry
the play, but in such a manner, that it has the
effect of a recommendation. They call it "a dull entertainment;"
and that is a dangerous word, I must
confess, from one of the greatest masters in human
<span class="pgnm">142</span><a id="page_142" name="page_142"></a>
nature, of that faculty. Now I can forgive them
this reproach too, after all the rest; for this play
does openly discover the original and root of the
practices and principles, both of their party and
cause; and they are so well acquainted with all the
trains and mazes of rebellion, that there is nothing
new to them in the whole history. Or what if it
were a little insipid, there was no conjuring that I
remember in "Pope Joan;" and the "Lancashire
Witches" were without doubt the most insipid jades
that ever flew upon a stage; and even these, by the
favour of a party, made a shift to hold up their
heads.<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-4">[4]</a> Now, if we have out-done these plays in
their own dull way, their authors have some sort of
<span class="pgnm">143</span><a id="page_143" name="page_143"></a>
privilege to throw the first stone; but we shall rather
chuse to yield the point of dulness, than contend
for it, against so indisputable a claim.</p>

<p>But "matters of state (it seems) are canvassed on
the stage, and things of the gravest concernment
there managed;" and who were the aggressors, I beseech
you, but a few factious, popular hirelings,
that by tampering the theatres, and by poisoning
the people, made a play-house more seditious than
a conventicle; so that the loyal party crave only
the same freedom of defending the government,
which the other took beforehand of exposing and
defaming it. There was no complaint of any disorders
of the stage, in the bustle that was made
(even to the forming of a party) to uphold a farce
of theirs.<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-5">[5]</a> Upon the first day, the whole faction
(in a manner) appeared; but after one sight of it,
they sent their proxies of serving-men and porters,
to clap in the right of their patrons; and it was impossible
ever to have gotten off the nonsense of
three hours for half-a-crown, but for the providence
of so congruous an audience. Thus far, I presume,
<span class="pgnm">144</span><a id="page_144" name="page_144"></a>
the reckoning is even, for bad plays on both sides,
and for plays written for a party. I shall say nothing
of their poets' affection to the government; unless
upon an absolute and an odious necessity. But to
return to the pretended Parallel.</p>

<p>I have said enough already to convince any man
of common sense, that there neither was, nor could
be, any Parallel intended; and it will farther appear,
from the nature of the subject; there being
no relation betwixt Henry the Third and the Duke
of Guise, except that of the king's marrying into
the family of Lorraine. If a comparison had been
designed, how easy had it been either to have found
a story, or to have invented one, where the ties of
nature had been nearer? If we consider their actions,
or their persons, a much less proportion will be
yet found betwixt them; and if we bate the popularity,
perhaps none at all. If we consider them in
reference to their parties, the one was manifestly
the leader; the other, at the worst, is but misled.
The designs of the one tended openly to usurpation;
those of the other may yet be interpreted more fairly;
and I hope, from the natural candour and probity
of his temper, that it will come to a perfect
submission and reconcilement at last. But that
which perfectly destroys this pretended Parallel is,
that our picture of the Duke of Guise is exactly according
to the original in the history; his actions,
his manners, nay, sometimes his very words, are so
justly copied, that whoever has read him in Davila,
sees him the same here. There is no going out of
the way, no dash of a pen to make any by-feature
resemble him to any other man; and indeed, excepting
his ambition, there was not in France, or
perhaps in any other country, any man of his age
<span class="pgnm">145</span><a id="page_145" name="page_145"></a>
vain enough to hope he could be mistaken for him.<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-6">[6]</a>
So that if you would have made a Parallel, we could
not. And yet I fancy, that where I make it my
business to draw likeness, it will be no hard matter
to judge who sate for the picture. For the Duke
of Guise's return to Paris contrary to the king's order,
enough already has been said; it was too considerable
in the story to be omitted, because it occasioned
the mischiefs that ensued. But in this likeness,
which was only casual, no danger followed. I
am confident there was none intended; and am satisfied
that none was feared. But the argument
drawn from our evident design is yet, if possible,
more convincing. The first words of the prologue
spake the play to be a Parallel, and then you are
immediately informed how far that Parallel extended,
and of what it is so: "The Holy League begot
the Covenant, Guisards got the Whig, &amp;c." So then
it is not, (as the snarling authors of the Reflections
tell you) a Parallel of the men, but of the times; a
Parallel of the factions, and of the leaguers. And
<span class="pgnm">146</span><a id="page_146" name="page_146"></a>
every one knows that this prologue was written before
the stopping of the play. Neither was the
name altered on any such account as they insinuate,
but laid aside long before, because a book called
the Parallel had been printed, resembling the French
League to the English Covenant; and therefore we
thought it not convenient to make use of another
man's title.<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-7">[7]</a> The chief person in the tragedy, or he
whose disasters are the subject of it, may in reason
give the name; and so it was called the "Duke of
Guise." Our intention therefore was to make the
play a Parallel betwixt the Holy League, plotted by
the house of Guise and its adherents, with the Covenant
plotted by the rebels in the time of king
Charles I. and those of the new Association, which
was the spawn of the old Covenant.</p>

<p>But this parallel is plain, that the exclusion of the
lawful heir was the main design of both parties;
and that the endeavours to get the lieutenancy of
France established on the head of the League, is in
effect the same with offering to get the militia out
of the king's hand (as declared by parliament,) and
consequently, that the power of peace and war should
be wholly in the people. It is also true that the
tumults in the city, in the choice of their officers,
have had no small resemblance with a Parisian rabble:
and I am afraid that both their faction and
ours had the same good lord. I believe also, that
if Julian had been written and calculated for the
Parisians, as it was for our sectaries, one of their
sheriffs might have mistaken too, and called him
<span class="pgnm">147</span><a id="page_147" name="page_147"></a>
Julian the Apostle.<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-8">[8]</a> I suppose I need not push this
point any further; where the parallel was intended,
I am certain it will reach; but a larger account of
the proceedings in the city may be expected from
a better hand, and I have no reason to forestall it.<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-9">[9]</a>
In the mean time, because there has been no actual
rebellion, the faction triumph in their loyalty; which
if it were out of principle, all our divisions would
soon be ended, and we the happy people, which
God and the constitution of our government have
put us in condition to be; but so long as they take
it for a maxim, that the king is but an officer in
trust, that the people, or their representatives, are
superior to him, judges of miscarriages, and have
power of revocation, it is a plain case, that whenever
they please they may take up arms; and, according
to their doctrine, lawfully too. Let them jointly
renounce this one opinion, as in conscience and law
they are bound to do, because both scripture and
acts of parliament oblige them to it, and we will
then thank their obedience for our quiet, whereas
now we are only beholden to them for their fear.
The miseries of the last war are yet too fresh in all
men's memory; and they are not rebels, only because
they have been so too lately. An author of
theirs has told us roundly the west-country proverb;
<span class="pgnm">148</span><a id="page_148" name="page_148"></a>
<i>Chud eat more cheese, and chad it;</i> their stomach
is as good as ever it was; but the mischief
on't is, they are either muzzled, or want their
teeth. If there were as many fanatics now in England,
as there were christians in the empire, when
Julian reigned, I doubt we should not find them
much inclined to passive obedience; and, "Curse ye
Meroz"<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-10">[10]</a> would be oftener preached upon, than "Give
to C&aelig;sar," except in the sense Mr Hunt means it.</p>

<p>Having clearly shewn wherein the parallel consisted,
which no man can mistake, who does not wilfully,
I need not justify myself, in what concerns
the sacred person of his majesty. Neither the French
history, nor our own, could have supplied me, nor
Plutarch himself, were he now alive, could have
found a Greek or Roman to have compared to him,
in that eminent virtue of his clemency; even his
enemies must acknowledge it to be superlative, because
they live by it. Far be it from flattery, if I
say, that there is nothing under heaven, which can
furnish me with a parallel; and that, in his mercy,
he is of all men the truest image of his Maker.</p>

<p>Henry III. was a prince of a mixed character;
he had, as an old historian says of another, <i>magnas
virtutes, nec minora vitia;</i> but amongst those virtues,
<span class="pgnm">149</span><a id="page_149" name="page_149"></a>
I do not find his forgiving qualities to be much celebrated.
That he was deeply engaged in the bloody
massacre of St Bartholomew, is notoriously known;
and if the relation printed in the memoirs of Villeroy
be true, he confesses there that the Admiral
having brought him and the queen-mother into suspicion
with his brother then reigning, for endeavouring
to lessen his authority, and draw it to themselves,
he first designed his accuser's death by Maurevel,
who shot him with a carbine, but failed to
kill him; after which, he pushed on the king to
that dreadful revenge, which immediately succeeded.
It is true, the provocations were high; there
had been reiterated rebellions, but a peace was now
concluded; it was solemnly sworn to by both parties,
and as great an assurance of safety given to
the protestants, as the word of a king and public
instruments could make it. Therefore the punishment
was execrable, and it pleased God, (if we may
dare to judge of his secret providence,) to cut off
that king in the very flower of his youth, to blast
his successor in his undertakings, to raise against
him the Duke of Guise, the complotter and executioner
of that inhuman action, (who, by the divine
justice, fell afterwards into the same snare which he
had laid for others,) and, finally, to die a violent
death himself, murdered by a priest, an enthusiast
of his own religion.<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-11">[11]</a> From these premises, let it
be concluded, if reasonably it can, that we could
draw a parallel, where the lines were so diametrically
opposite. We were indeed obliged, by the
laws of poetry, to cast into shadows the vices of
<span class="pgnm">150</span><a id="page_150" name="page_150"></a>
this prince; for an excellent critic has lately told
us, that when a king is named, a hero is supposed;<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-12">[12]</a>
it is a reverence due to majesty, to make the virtues
as conspicuous, and the vices as obscure, as we
can possibly; and this, we own, we have either
performed, or at least endeavoured. But if we were
more favourable to that character than the exactness
of history would allow, we have been far from
diminishing a greater, by drawing it into comparison.
You may see, through the whole conduct of
the play, a king naturally severe, and a resolution
carried on to revenge himself to the uttermost on
the rebellious conspirators. That this was sometimes
shaken by reasons of policy and pity, is confessed;
but it always returned with greater force,
and ended at last in the ruin of his enemies. In
the mean time we cannot but observe the wonderful
loyalty on the other side; that the play was to
be stopped, because the king was represented. May
we have many such proofs of their duty and respect!
but there was no occasion for them here.
It is to be supposed, that his majesty himself was
made acquainted with this objection; if he were so,
he was the supreme and only judge of it; and then
the event justifies us. If it were inspected only by
those whom he commanded, it is hard if his own
officers and servants should not see as much ill in it
as other men, and be as willing to prevent it; especially
when there was no solicitation used to have
<span class="pgnm">151</span><a id="page_151" name="page_151"></a>
it acted. It is known that noble person,<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-13">[13]</a> to whom
it was referred, is a severe critic on good sense, decency,
and morality; and I can assure the world,
that the rules of Horace are more familiar to him,
than they are to me. He remembers too well that
the <i>vetus com&aelig;dia</i> was banished from the Athenian
theatre for its too much licence in representing persons,
and would never have pardoned it in this or
any play.</p>

<p>What opinion Henry III. had of his successor, is
evident from the words he spoke upon his deathbed:
"he exhorted the nobility," says Davila, "to
acknowledge the king of Navarre, to whom the
kingdom of right belonged; and that they should
not stick at the difference of religion; for both the
king of Navarre, a man of a sincere noble nature,
would in the end return into the bosom of the
church, and the pope, being better informed, would
receive him into his favour, to prevent the ruin of
the whole kingdom." I hope I shall not need in
this quotation to defend myself, as if it were my
opinion, that the pope has any right to dispose
of kingdoms; my meaning is evident, that the
king's judgment of his brother-in-law, was the same
which I have copied; and I must farther add from
Davila, that the arguments I have used in defence
of that succession were chiefly drawn from the
king's answer to the deputies, as they may be seen
more at large in pages 730, and 731, of the first
edition of that history in English. There the three
estates, to the wonder of all men, jointly concurred
in cutting off the succession; the clergy, who were
managed by the archbishop of Lyons and cardinal
<span class="pgnm">152</span><a id="page_152" name="page_152"></a>
of Guise, were the first who promoted it; and the
commons and nobility afterwards consented, as referring
themselves, says our author, to the clergy;
so that there was only the king to stand in the gap;
and he by artifice diverted that storm which was
breaking upon posterity.</p>

<p>The crown was then reduced to the lowest ebb
of its authority; and the king, in a manner, stood
single, and yet preserved his negative entire; but
if the clergy and nobility had been on his part of
the balance, it might reasonably be supposed, that
the meeting of those estates at Blois had healed the
breaches of the nation, and not forced him to the
<i>ratio ultima regum</i>, which is never to be praised, nor
is it here, but only excused as the last result of his
necessity. As for the parallel betwixt the king of
Navarre, and any other prince now living, what
likeness the God of Nature, and the descent of virtues
in the same channel have produced, is evident;
I have only to say, that the nation certainly is happy,
where the royal virtues of the progenitors are
derived on their descendants.<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-14">[14]</a></p>

<p>In that scene, it is true, there is but one of the
three estates mentioned; but the other two are virtually
included; for the archbishop and cardinal are
at the head of the deputies: And that the rest are
mute persons every critic understands the reason,
<i>ne quarta loqui persona laboret</i>. I am never willing
to cumber the stage with many speakers, when I
can reasonably avoid it, as here I might. And
what if I had a mind to pass over the clergy and
nobility of France in silence, and to excuse them
from joining in so illegal, and so ungodly a decree?
<span class="pgnm">153</span><a id="page_153" name="page_153"></a>
Am I tied in poetry to the strict rules of history?
I have followed it in this play more closely than
suited with the laws of the drama, and a great victory
they will have, who shall discover to the world
this wonderful secret, that I have not observed the
unities of place and time; but are they better kept
in the farce of the "Libertine destroyed?"<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-15">[15]</a> It was
our common business here to draw the parallel of
the times, and not to make an exact tragedy. For
this once we were resolved to err with honest Shakespeare;
neither can "Catiline" or "Sejanus," (written
by the great master of our art,) stand excused, any
more than we, from this exception; but if we must
be criticised, some plays of our adversaries may be
exposed, and let them reckon their gains when the
dispute is ended. I am accused of ignorance, for
speaking of the third estate, as not sitting in the
same house with the other two. Let not those
gentlemen mistake themselves; there are many
things in plays to be accommodated to the country
in which we live; I spoke to the understanding of
an English audience. Our three estates now sit, and
have long done so, in two houses; but our records
bear witness, that they, according to the French
custom, have sate in one; that is, the lords spiritual
and temporal within the bar, and the commons
without it. If that custom had been still continued
<span class="pgnm">154</span><a id="page_154" name="page_154"></a>
here, it should have been so represented; but
being otherwise, I was forced to write so as to be
understood by our own countrymen. If these be
errors, a bigger poet than either of us two has fallen
into greater, and the proofs are ready, whenever the
suit shall be recommenced.</p>

<p>Mr Hunt, the Jehu of the party, begins very furiously
with me, and says, "I have already condemned
the charter and city, and have executed the
magistrates in effigy upon the stage, in a play called
the Duke of Guise, frequently acted and applauded,
&amp;c.<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-16">[16]</a>"</p>

<p>Compare the latter end of this sentence with what
the two authors of the Reflections, or perhaps the
Associating Club of the Devil-tavern<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-17">[17]</a> write in the
<span class="pgnm">155</span><a id="page_155" name="page_155"></a>
beginning of their libel:&mdash;"Never was mountain
delivered of such a mouse; the fiercest Tories have
been ashamed to defend this piece; they who have
any sparks of wit among them are so true to their
pleasure, that they will not suffer dulness to pass
upon them for wit, nor tediousness for diversion;
which is the reason that this piece has not met with
the expected applause: I never saw a play more deficient
in wit, good characters, or entertainment, than
this is."</p>

<p>For shame, gentlemen, pack your evidence a little
better against another time. You see, my lord chief
baron<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-18">[18]</a> has delivered his opinion, that the play was frequently
acted and applauded; but you of the jury
have found <i>Ignoramus</i>, on the wit and the success
of it. Oates, Dugdale and Turberville, never disagreed
more than you do; let us know at last, which
of the witnesses are true Protestants, and which are
Irish<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-19">[19]</a>. But it seems your authors had contrary
<span class="pgnm">156</span><a id="page_156" name="page_156"></a>
designs: Mr Hunt thought fit to say, "it was frequently
acted and applauded, because," says he, "it
was intended to provoke the rabble into tumults
and disorder." Now, if it were not seen frequently,
this argument would lose somewhat of its force.
The Reflector's business went another way; it was
to be allowed no reputation, no success; but to be
damned root and branch, to prevent the prejudice
it might do their party: accordingly, as much as
in them lay, they have drawn a bill of exclusion for
it on the stage. But what rabble was it to provoke?
Are the audience of a play-house, which are generally
persons of honour, noblemen, and ladies, or, at
worst, as one of your authors calls his gallants, men
of wit and pleasure about the town<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-20">[20]</a>,&mdash;are these the
rabble of Mr Hunt? I have seen a rabble at Sir Edmundbury
Godfrey's night, and have heard of such
a name as true Protestant meeting-houses; but a
rabble is not to be provoked, where it never comes.
Indeed, we had one in this tragedy, but it was upon
the stage; and that's the reason why your Reflectors
would break the glass, which has shewed them their
own faces. The business of the theatre is to expose
vice and folly; to dissuade men by examples
from one, and to shame them out of the other.
<span class="pgnm">157</span><a id="page_157" name="page_157"></a>
And however you may pervert our good intentions,
it was here particularly to reduce men to loyalty,
by shewing the pernicious consequences of rebellion,
and popular insurrections. I believe no man, who
loves the government, would be glad to see the
rabble in such a posture, as they were represented
in our play; but if the tragedy had ended on your
side, the play had been a loyal witty poem; the success
of it should have been recorded by immortal
Og or Doeg<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-21">[21]</a>, and the rabble scene should have
been true Protestant, though a whig-devil were at
the head of it.</p>

<p>In the mean time, pray, where lies the relation
betwixt the "Tragedy of the Duke of Guise," and
the charter of London? Mr Hunt has found a rare
connection, for he tacks them together, by the kicking
of the sheriff's. That chain of thought was a
little ominous, for something like a kicking has succeeded
the printing of his book; and the charter of
London was the quarrel. For my part, I have not
law enough to state that question, much less decide
it; let the charter shift for itself in Westminster-hall
the government is somewhat wiser than to employ
my ignorance on such a subject. My promise
to honest Nat. Lee, was the only bribe I had, to
engage me in this trouble; for which he has the
good fortune to escape Scot-free, and I am left in
pawn for the reckoning, who had the least share in
the entertainment. But the rising, it seems, should
have been on the true protestant side; "for he has
tried," says ingenious Mr Hunt, "what he could
<span class="pgnm">158</span><a id="page_158" name="page_158"></a>
do, towards making the charter forfeitable, by some
extravagancy and disorder of the people." A wise
man I had been, doubtless, for my pains, to raise the
rabble to a tumult, where I had been certainly one
of the first men whom they had limbed, or dragged
to the next convenient sign-post.</p>

<p>But on second thought, he says, this ought not
to move the citizens. He is much in the right; for
the rabble scene was written on purpose to keep his
party of them in the bounds of duty. It is the business
of factious men to stir up the populace: Sir
Edmond on horseback, attended by a swinging
pope in effigy, and forty thousand true protestants
for his guard to execution, are a show more proper
for that design, than a thousand stage-plays<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-22">[22]</a>.</p>

<p>Well, he has fortified his opinion with a reason,
however, why the people should not be moved;
"because I have so maliciously and mischievously
represented the king, and the king's son; nay, and
his favourite," saith he, "the duke too; to whom I
give the worst strokes of my unlucky fancy."</p>

<p>This need not be answered; for it is already manifest
that neither the king, nor the king's son, are
represented; neither that son he means, nor any of
the rest, God bless them all. What strokes of my
unlucky fancy I have given to his royal highness,
will be seen; and it will be seen also, who strikes
him worst and most unluckily.</p>

<p>"The Duke of Guise," he tells us, "ought to
have represented a great prince, that had inserved
to some most detestable villainy, to please the rage
or lust of a tyrant; such great courtiers have been
often sacrificed, to appease the furies of the tyrant's
guilty conscience; to expiate for his sin, and to attone
<span class="pgnm">159</span><a id="page_159" name="page_159"></a>
the people. For a tyrant naturally stands in
fear of such wicked ministers, is obnoxious to them,
awed by them, and they drag him to greater evils,
for their own impunity, than they perpetrated for
his pleasure, and their own ambition<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-23">[23]</a>."</p>

<p>Sure, he said not all this for nothing. I would
know of him, on what persons he would fix the
sting of this sharp satire? What two they are, whom,
to use his own words, he "so maliciously and mischievously
would represent?" For my part, I dare
not understand the villainy of his meaning; but
somebody was to have been shown a tyrant, and
some other "a great prince, inserving to some detestable
villainy, and to that tyrant's rage and lust;"
this great prince or courtier ought to be sacrificed,
to atone the people, and the tyrant is persuaded,
for his own interest, to give him up to public justice.
I say no more, but that he has studied the law to
good purpose. He is dancing on the rope without
a metaphor; his knowledge of the law is the staff
that poizes him, and saves his neck. The party, indeed,
speaks out sometimes, for wickedness is not
always so wise as to be secret, especially when it
is driven to despair. By some of their discourses,
we may guess at whom he points; but he has fenced
himself in with so many evasions, that he is safe
in his sacrilege; and he, who dares to answer him,
may become obnoxious. It is true, he breaks a
little out of the clouds, within two paragraphs; for
there he tells you, that "Caius C&aelig;sar (to give into
C&aelig;sar the things that were C&aelig;sar's,) was in the catiline
<span class="pgnm">160</span><a id="page_160" name="page_160"></a>
conspiracy;" a fine insinuation this, to be
sneered at by his party, and yet not to be taken
hold of by public justice. They would be glad now,
that I, or any man, should bolt out their covert treason
for them; for their loop-hole is ready, that the
C&aelig;sar, here spoken of, was a private man. But the
application of the text declares the author's to be
another C&aelig;sar; which is so black and so infamous
an aspersion, that nothing less than the highest
clemency can leave it unpunished. I could reflect
on his ignorance in this place, for attributing these
words to C&aelig;sar, "He that is not with us, is against
us:" He seems to have mistaken them out of the
New-Testament, and that is the best defence I can
make for him; for if he did it knowingly, it was
impiously done, to put our Saviour's words into
C&aelig;sar's mouth. But his law and our gospel are
two things; this gentleman's knowledge is not of
the bible, any more than his practice is according
to it. He tells you, he will give the world a taste
of my atheism and impiety; for which he quotes
these following verses, in the second or third act of
the "Duke of Guise."</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>For conscience or heaven's fear, religious rules,</p>
<p>Are all state bells, to toll in pious fools.</p>
</div>

<p>In the first place, he is mistaken in his man, for
the verses are not mine, but Mr Lee's: I asked him
concerning them, and have this account,&mdash;that they
were spoken by the devil; now, what can either
whig or devil say, more proper to their character,
than that religion is only a name, a stalking-horse,
as errant a property as godliness and property themselves
are amongst their party? Yet for these two
lines, which, in the mouth that speaks them, are
of no offence, he halloos on the whole pack against
me: judge, justice, surrogate, and official are to be
employed, at his suit, to direct process; and boring
<span class="pgnm">161</span><a id="page_161" name="page_161"></a>
through the tongue for blasphemy, is the least punishment
his charity will allow me.</p>

<p>I find it is happy for me, that he was not made
a judge, and yet I had as lieve have him my judge
as my council, if my life were at stake. My poor
Lord Stafford was well helped up with this gentleman
for his solicitor: no doubt, he gave that unfortunate
nobleman most admirable advice towards the
saving of his life; and would have rejoiced exeedingly,
to have seen him cleared<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-24">[24]</a>. I think, I have
disproved his instance of my atheism; it remains for
him to justify his religion, in putting the words of
Christ into a Heathen's mouth; and much more in
his prophane allusion to the scripture, in the other
text,&mdash;"Give unto C&aelig;sar the things that are C&aelig;sar's;"
which, if it be not a profanation of the bible,
for the sake of a silly witticism, let all men, but his
own party, judge. I am not malicious enough to
return him the names which he has called me; but
of all sins, I thank God, I have always abhorred
atheism; and I had need be a better Christian than
Mr Hunt has shown himself, if I forgive him so infamous
a slander.</p>

<p>But as he has mistaken our Saviour for Julius C&aelig;sar,
so he would Pompey too, if he were let alone;
to him, and to his cause, or to the like cause it belonged,
he says, to use these words:&mdash;"he that is
not for us is against us." I find he cares not whose
the expression is, so it be not Christ's. But how
comes Pompey the Great to be a whig? He was, indeed,
<span class="pgnm">162</span><a id="page_162" name="page_162"></a>
a defender of the ancient established Roman government;
but C&aelig;sar was the whig who took up
arms unlawfully to subvert it. Our liberties and our
religion both are safe; they are secured to us by the
laws; and those laws are executed under an established
government, by a lawful king. The Defender
of our Faith is the defender of our common
freedom; to cabal, to write, to rail against this administration
are all endeavours to destroy the government;
and to oppose the succession, in any private
man, is a treasonable practice against the foundation
of it. Pompey very honourably maintained
the liberty of his country, which was governed by
a common-wealth: so that there lies no parallel betwixt
his cause and Mr Hunt's, except in the bare
notion of a common-wealth, as it is opposed to
monarchy; and that's the thing he would obliquely
slur upon us. Yet on these premises, he is for ordering
my lord chief justice to grant out warrants
against all those who have applauded the "Duke of
Guise;" as if they committed a riot when they
clapped. I suppose they paid for their places, as
well as he and his party did, who hissed. If he were
not half distracted, for not being lord chief baron,
methinks he should be lawyer enough to advise my
lord chief justice better. To clap and hiss are the
privileges of a free-born subject in a playhouse:
they buy them with their money, and their hands
and mouths are their own property. It belongs to
the Master of the Revels to see that no treason or
immorality be in the play; but when it is acted, let
every man like or dislike freely: not but that respect
should be used too, in the presence of the
king; for by his permission the actors are allowed:
it is due to his person, as he is sacred; and to the
successors, as being next related to him: there
are opportunities enow for men to hiss, who are so
<span class="pgnm">163</span><a id="page_163" name="page_163"></a>
disposed, in their absence; for when the king is in
sight, though but by accident, a malefactor is reprieved
from death. Yet such is the duty, and good
manners of these good subjects, that they forbore
not some rudeness in his majesty's presence; but
when his Royal Highness and his court were only
there, they pushed it as far as their malice had
power; and if their party had been more numerous,
the affront had been greater.</p>

<p>The next paragraph of our author's is a panegyric
on the Duke of Monmouth, which concerns not
me, who am very far from detracting from him.
The obligations I have had to him, were those of
his countenance, his favour, his good word, and his
esteem; all which I have likewise had, in a greater
measure, from his excellent duchess, the patroness
of my poor unworthy poetry. If I had not greater,
the fault was never in their want of goodness
to me, but in my own backwardness to ask, which
has always, and, I believe, will ever, keep me from
rising in the world. Let this be enough, with reasonable
men, to clear me from the imputation of an
ungrateful man, with which my enemies have most
unjustly taxed me. If I am a mercenary scribbler,
the lords commissioners of the treasury best know:
I am sure, they have found me no importunate solicitor;
for I know myself, I deserved little, and,
therefore, have never desired much. I return that
slander, with just disdain, on my accusers: it is for
men who have ill consciences to suspect others; I
am resolved to stand or fall with the cause of my
God, my king, and country; never to trouble myself
for any railing aspersions, which I have not deserved;
and to leave it as a portion to my children,&mdash;that
they had a father, who durst do his
duty, and was neither covetous nor mercenary.</p>

<p>As little am I concerned at that imputation of
<span class="pgnm">164</span><a id="page_164" name="page_164"></a>
my back-friends, that I have confessed myself to be
put on to write as I do. If they mean this play in
particular, that is notoriously proved against them
to be false; for the rest of my writings, my hatred
of their practices and principles was cause enough
to expose them as I have done, and will do more.
I do not think as they do; for, if I did, I must
think treason; but I must in conscience write as I
do, because I know, which is more than thinking,
that I write for a lawful established government,
against anarchy, innovation, and sedition: but
"these lies (as prince Harry said to Falstaff) are as
gross as he that made them<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-25">[25]</a>." More I need not
say, for I am accused without witness. I fear not
any of their evidences, not even him of Salamanca;
who though he has disowned his doctorship in
Spain, yet there are some allow him to have taken
a certain degree in Italy; a climate, they say, more
proper for his masculine constitution<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-26">[26]</a>. To conclude
this ridiculous accusation against me, I know
but four men, in their whole party, to whom I have
spoken for above this year last past; and with them
neither, but casually and cursorily. We have been
acquaintance of a long standing, many years before
<span class="pgnm">165</span><a id="page_165" name="page_165"></a>
this accursed plot divided men into several parties;
I dare call them to witness, whether the most I have
at any time said will amount to more than this, that
"I hoped the time would come, when these names
of whig and tory would cease among us; and that
we might live together, as we had done formerly."
I have, since this pamphlet, met accidentally with
two of them; and I am sure, they are so far from
being my accusers, that they have severally owned
to me, that all men, who espouse a party, must expect
to be blackened by the contrary side; that
themselves knew nothing of it, nor of the authors
of the "Reflections." It remains, therefore, to be
considered, whether, if I were as much a knave as
they would make me, I am fool enough to be guilty
of this charge; and whether they, who raised it,
would have made it public, if they had thought I
was theirs inwardly. For it is plain, they are glad of
worse scribblers than I am, and maintain them too,
as I could prove, if I envied them their miserable
subsistence. I say no more, but let my actions
speak for me: <i>Spectemur agendo,</i>&mdash;that is the trial.</p>

<p>Much less am I concerned at the noble name of
Bayes; that is a brat so like his own father, that he
cannot be mistaken for any other body<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-27">[27]</a>. They
<span class="pgnm">166</span><a id="page_166" name="page_166"></a>
might as reasonably have called Tom Sternhold,
Virgil, and the resemblance would have held as
well.</p>

<p>As for knave, and sycophant, and rascal, and impudent,
and devil, and old serpent, and a thousand
such good morrows, I take them to be only names
of parties; and could return murderer, and cheat,
and whig-napper, and sodomite; and, in short, the
goodly number of the seven deadly sins, with all
their kindred and relations, which are names of parties
too; but saints will be saints, in spite of villainy.
I believe they would pass themselves upon
us for such a compound as mithridate, or Venice-treacle;
as if whiggism were an admirable cordial
in the mass, though the several ingredients are rank
poisons.</p>

<p>But if I think either Mr Hunt a villain, or know
any of my Reflectors to be ungrateful rogues, I do
not owe them so much kindness as to call them so;
for I am satisfied that to prove them either, would
but recommend them to their own party. Yet if
some will needs make a merit of their infamy, and
provoke a legend of their sordid lives, I think they
must be gratified at last; and though I will not
take the scavenger's employment from him, yet I
may be persuaded to point at some men's doors, who
have heaps of filth before them. But this must be
when they have a little angered me; for hitherto
I am provoked no further than to smile at them.
And indeed, to look upon the whole faction in a
lump, never was a more pleasant sight than to behold
these builders of a new Babel, how ridiculously
they are mixed, and what a rare confusion there is
amongst them. One part of them is carrying stone
and mortar for the building of a meeting-house;
another sort understand not that language; they
are for snatching away their work-fellows' materials
<span class="pgnm">167</span><a id="page_167" name="page_167"></a>
to set up a bawdy-house: some of them blaspheme,
and others pray; and both, I believe, with equal
godliness at bottom: some of them are atheists,
some sectaries, yet all true protestants. Most of
them love all whores, but her of Babylon. In few
words, any man may be what he will, so he be one
of them. It is enough to despise the King, to hate
the Duke, and rail at the succession: after this it is
no matter how a man lives; he is a saint by infection;
he goes along with the party, has their mark
upon him; his wickedness is no more than frailty;
their righteousness is imputed to him: so that, as
ignorant rogues go out doctors when a prince comes
to an university, they hope, at the last day, to take
their degree in a crowd of true protestants, and
thrust unheeded into heaven<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-28">[28]</a>.</p>

<p>It is a credit to be railed at by such men as these.
The charter-man, in the very title-page, where he
hangs out the cloth of the city before his book,
gives it for his motto, <i>Si populus vult decipi, decipiatur</i><a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-29">[29]</a>;
as if he should have said, "you have a mind
to be cozened, and the devil give you good on't."
If I cry a sirreverence, and you take it for honey,
make the best of your bargain. For shame, good
Christians, can you suffer such a man to starve, when
you see his design is upon your purses? He is contented
to expose the ears representative of your
party on the pillory, and is in a way of doing you
<span class="pgnm">168</span><a id="page_168" name="page_168"></a>
more service than a worn-out witness, who can
hang nobody hereafter but himself. He tells you,
"The papists clap their hands, in the hopes they
conceive of the ruin of your government:" Does
not this single syllable <i>your</i> deserve a pension, if
he can prove the government to be yours, and that
the king has nothing to do in your republic? He
continues, as if that were as sure and certain to
them, as it is to us, without doubt, that they (the
papists) once fired the city, just as certain in your
own consciences. I wish the papists had no more
to answer for than that accusation. Pray let it be
put to the vote, and resolved upon the question, by
your whole party, that the North-east wind is not
only ill-affected to man and beast, but is also a tory
or tantivy papist in masquerade<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-30">[30]</a>. I am satisfied, not
to have "so much art left me, as to frame any thing
agreeable, or verisimilar;" but it is plain that he has,
and therefore, as I ought in justice, I resign my
laurel, and my bays too, to Mr Hunt; it is he sets
up for the poet now, and has the only art to amuse
and to deceive the people. You may see how profound
his knowledge is in poetry; for he tells you
just before, "that my heroes are commonly such monsters
as Theseus and Hercules; renowned throughout
all ages for destroying<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-31">[31]</a>." Now Theseus and
<span class="pgnm">169</span><a id="page_169" name="page_169"></a>
Hercules, you know, have been the heroes of all poets,
and have been renowned through all ages, for destroying
monsters, for succouring the distressed, and
for putting to death inhuman arbitrary tyrants. Is
this your oracle? If he were to write the acts and
monuments of whig heroes, I find they should be
quite contrary to mine: Destroyers indeed,&mdash;but of
a lawful government; murderers,&mdash;but of their fellow-subjects;
lovers, as Hercules was of Hylas;
with a journey at last to hell, like that of Theseus.</p>

<p>But mark the wise consequences of our author.
"I have not," he says, "so much art left me to
make any thing agreeable, or verisimilar, wherewith
to amuse or deceive the people." And yet, in the
very next paragraph, "my province is to corrupt the
manners of the nation, and lay waste their morals,
and my endeavours are more happily applied, to extinguish
the little remainders of the virtue of the
age." Now, I am to perform all this, it seems, without
making any thing verisimilar or agreeable! Why,
Pharaoh never set the Israelites such a task, to
build pyramids without brick or straw. If the fool
knows it not, verisimilitude and agreeableness are
the very tools to do it; but I am willing to disclaim
them both, rather than to use them to so ill
purpose as he has done.</p>

<p>Yet even this their celebrated writer knows no
more of stile and English than the Northern dictator;
as if dulness and clumsiness were fatal to the
name of <i>Tom</i>. It is true, he is a fool in three languages
more than the poet; for, they say, "he understands
<span class="pgnm">170</span><a id="page_170" name="page_170"></a>
Latin, Greek, and Hebrew," from all
which, to my certain knowledge, I acquit the other.
Og may write against the king, if he pleases, so
long as he drinks for him, and his writings will
never do the government so much harm, as his
drinking does it good; for true subjects will not
be much perverted by his libels; but the wine-duties
rise considerably by his claret. He has often
called me an atheist in print; I would believe more
charitably of him, and that he only goes the broad
way, because the other is too narrow for him. He
may see, by this, I do not delight to meddle with
his course of life, and his immoralities, though I
have a long bead-roll of them. I have hitherto
contented myself with the ridiculous part of him,
which is enough, in all conscience, to employ one
man; even without the story of his late fall at the
Old Devil, where he broke no ribs, because the
hardness of the stairs could reach no bones; and,
for my part, I do not wonder how he came to fall,
for I have always known him heavy: the miracle
is, how he got up again. I have heard of a sea
captain as fat as he, who, to escape arrests, would
lay himself flat upon the ground, and let the bailiffs
carry him to prison, if they could. If a messenger
or two, nay, we may put in three or four, should
come, he has friendly advertisement how to escape
them. But to leave him, who is not worth any
further consideration, now I have done laughing at
him,&mdash;would every man knew his own talent, and
that they, who are only born for drinking, would
let both poetry and prose alone<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-32">[32]</a>!</p>

<p><span class="pgnm">171</span><a id="page_171" name="page_171"></a>
I am weary with tracing the absurdities and mistakes
of our great lawyer, some of which indeed are
wilful; as where he calls the <i>Trimmers</i> the more
moderate sort of tories. It seems those politicians
are odious to both sides; for neither own them to
be theirs. We know them, and so does he too in
his conscience, to be secret whigs, if they are any
thing; but now the designs of whiggism are openly
discovered, they tack about to save a stake; that
is, they will not be villains to their own ruin. While
the government was to be destroyed, and there was
probability of compassing it, no men were so violent
as they; but since their fortunes are in hazard
<span class="pgnm">172</span><a id="page_172" name="page_172"></a>
by the law, and their places at court by the king's
displeasure, they pull in their horns, and talk more
peaceably; in order, I suppose, to their vehemence
on the right side, if they were to be believed. For
in laying of colours, they observe a medium; black
and white are too far distant to be placed directly
by one another, without some shadowings to soften
their contrarieties. It is Mariana, I think, (but am not
certain) that makes the following relation; and let
the noble family of Trimmers read their own fortune
in it. "Don Pedro, king of Castile, surnamed
the Cruel, who had been restored by the valour of
our Edward the Black Prince, was finally dispossessed
by Don Henry, the bastard, and he enjoyed
the kingdom quietly, till his death; which when
he felt approaching, he called his son to him, and
gave him this his last counsel. I have (said he,) gained
this kingdom, which I leave you, by the sword;
for the right of inheritance was in Don Pedro; but
the favour of the people, who hated my brother for
his tyranny, was to me instead of title. You are
now to be the peaceable possessor of what I have
unjustly gotten; and your subjects are composed
of these three sorts of men. One party espoused
my brother's quarrel, which was the undoubted
lawful cause; those, though they were my enemies,
were men of principle and honour: Cherish them,
and exalt them into places of trust about you, for
in them you may confide safely, who prized their
fidelity above their fortune. Another sort, are they
who fought my cause against Don Pedro; to those
you are indeed obliged, because of the accidental
good they did me; for they intended only their private
benefit, and helped to raise me, that I might
afterwards promote them: you may continue them
in their offices, if you please; but trust them no
farther than you are forced; for what they did was
<span class="pgnm">173</span><a id="page_173" name="page_173"></a>
against their conscience. But there is a third sort,
which, during the whole wars, were neuters; let
them be crushed on all occasions, for their business
was only their own security. They had neither
courage enough to engage on my side, nor conscience
enough to help their lawful sovereign: <i>Therefore
let them be made examples, as the worst sort of
interested men, which certainly are enemies to both,
and would be profitable to neither.</i>"</p>

<p>I have only a dark remembrance of this story,
and have not the Spanish author by me, but, I think,
I am not much mistaken in the main of it; and
whether true or false, the counsel given, I am sure,
is such, as ought, in common prudence, to be practised
against Trimmers, whether the lawful or unlawful
cause prevail. Loyal men may justly be displeased
with this party, not for their moderation,
as Mr Hunt insinuates, but because, under that
mask of seeming mildness, there lies hidden either
a deep treachery, or, at best, an interested luke-warmness.
But he runs riot into almost treasonable
expressions, as if "Trimmers were hated because
they are not perfectly wicked, or perfectly deceived;
of the Catiline make, bold, and without understanding;
that can adhere to men that publicly profess
murders, and applaud the design:" by all which
villainous names he opprobriously calls his majesty's
most loyal subjects; as if men must be perfectly
wicked, who endeavour to support a lawful government;
or perfectly deceived, who on no occasion
dare take up arms against their sovereign: as if
acknowledging the right of succession, and resolving
to maintain it in the line, were to be in a Catiline
conspiracy; and at last, (which is ridiculous
enough, after so much serious treason) as if "to clap
the Duke of Guise" were to adhere to men that publicly
profess murders, and applaud the design of the
assassinating poets.</p>

<p><span class="pgnm">174</span><a id="page_174" name="page_174"></a>
But together with his villainies, pray let his incoherences
be observed. He commends the Trimmers,
(at least tacitly excuses them) for men of
some moderation; and this in opposition to the instruments
of wickedness of the Catiline make, that
are resolute and forward, and without consideration.
But he forgets all this in the next twenty lines;
for there he gives them their own, and tells them
roundly, <i>in internecino bello, medii pro hostibus habentur.</i>
Neutral men are traitors, and assist by their
indifferency to the destruction of the government.
The plain English of his meaning is this; while
matters are only in dispute, and in machination, he
is contented they should be moderate; but when
once the faction can bring about a civil war, then
they are traitors, if they declare not openly for them.</p>

<p>"But it is not," says he, "the Duke of Guise
who is to be assassinated, a turbulent, wicked, and
haughty courtier, but an innocent and gentle prince."
By his favour, our Duke of Guise was neither innocent
nor gentle, nor a prince of the blood royal,
though he pretended to descend from Charlemagne,
and a genealogy was printed to that purpose, for
which the author was punished, as he deserved; witness
Davila, and the journals of Henry III. where
the story is at large related. Well, who is it then?
why, "it is a prince who has no fault, but that he is
the king's son:" then he has no fault by consequence;
for I am certain, that is no fault of his.
The rest of the compliment is so silly, and so fulsome,
as if he meant it all in ridicule; and to conclude
the jest, he says, that "the best people of
England have no other way left, to shew their loyalty
to the king, their religion and government, in
long intervals of parliament, than by prosecuting
his son, for the sake of the king, and his own merit,
with all the demonstrations of the highest esteem."</p>

<p><span class="pgnm">175</span><a id="page_175" name="page_175"></a>
Yes, I can tell them one other way to express their
loyalty, which is, to obey the king, and to respect his
brother, as the next lawful successor; their religion
commands them both, and the government is secured
in so doing. But why in intervals of parliament?
How are they more obliged to honour the
king's son out of parliament, than in it? And why
this prosecution of love for the king's sake? Has
he ordered more love to be shewn to one son, than
to another? Indeed, his own quality is cause sufficient
for all men to respect him, and I am of their
number, who truly honour him, and who wish him
better than this miserable sycophant; for I wish
him, from his father's royal kindness, what justice
can make him, which is a greater honour than the
rabble can confer upon him.</p>

<p>But our author finds, that commendation is no
more his talent, than flattery was that of &AElig;sop's
ass; and therefore falls immediately, from pawing
with his fore-feet, and grinning upon one prince, to
downright braying against another.</p>

<p>He says, I have not used "my patron duke much
better; for I have put him under a most dismal and
unfortunate character of a successor, excluded from
the crown by act of state, for his religion; who
fought his way to the crown, changed his religion,
and died by the hand of a Roman assassinate."</p>

<p>If it please his Royal Highness to be my patron, I
have reason to be proud of it; because he never yet
forsook any man, whom he has had the goodness to
own for his. But how have I put him under an
unfortunate character? the authors of the Reflections,
and our John-a-Nokes, have not laid their
noddles together about this accusation. For it is
their business to prove the king of Navarre to have
been a most successful, magnanimous, gentle, and
grateful prince; in which character they have followed
<span class="pgnm">176</span><a id="page_176" name="page_176"></a>
the stream of all historians. How then happens
this jarring amongst friends, that the same
man is put under such dismal circumstances on one
side, and so fortunate on the other, by the writers
of the same party? The answer is very plain; that
they take the cause by several handles. They, who
will not have the Duke resemble the king of Navarre,
have magnified the character of that prince,
to debase his Royal Highness; and therein done
what they can to shew the disparity. Mr Hunt,
who will have it to be the Duke's character, has
blackened that king as much as he is able, to shew
the likeness. Now this would be ridiculous pleading
at a bar, by lawyers retained for the same cause;
and both sides would call each other fools, because
the jury betwixt them would be confounded, and
perhaps the judges too.</p>

<p>But this it is to have a bad cause, which puts
men of necessity upon knavery; and that knavery is
commonly found out. Well, Mr Hunt has in another
place confessed himself to be in passion, and
that is the reason he is so grosly mistaken in opening
of the cause. For, first, the king of Navarre was
neither under dismal, nor unfortunate circumstances:
before the end of that very sentence, our lawyer
has confessed, that he fought his way to the crown;
that is, he gloriously vanquished all his rebels, and
happily possessed his inheritance many years after
he had regained it. In the next place, he was never
excluded from the crown by act of state. He
changed his religion indeed, but not until he had
almost weathered the storm, recovered the best part
of his estate, and gained some glorious victories in
pitched battles; so that his changing cannot without
injustice be attributed to his fear. Monsieur
Chiverny, in his Memoirs of those times, plainly
tells us, that he solemnly promised to his predecessor
<span class="pgnm">177</span><a id="page_177" name="page_177"></a>
Henry III. then dying, that he would become
a Romanist; and Davila, though he says
not this directly, yet denies it not. By whose
hands Henry IV. died, is notoriously known; but
it is invidiously urged, both by Mr Hunt and the
Reflectors: for we may, to our shame, remember,
that a king of our own country was barbarously
murdered by his subjects, who professed the same
religion; though I believe, that neither Jaques
Clement, nor Ravaillac, were better papists, than
the independents and presbyterians were protestants;
so that their argument only proves, that
there are rogues of all religions: <i>Iliacos infra muros
peccatur, et extra.</i> But Mr Hunt follows his
blow again, that I have "offered a justification of an
act of exclusion against a popish successor in a protestant
kingdom, by remembering what was done
against the king of Navarre, who was <i>de facto</i> excluded
by an act of state." My gentleman, I perceive,
is very willing to call that an act of exclusion,
and an act of state, which is only, in our language,
called a bill; for Henry III. could never be
gained to pass it, though it was proposed by the
three estates at Blois. The Reflectors are more modest;
for they profess, (though I am afraid it is
somewhat against the grain,) that a vote of the
House of Commons is not an act; but the times
are turned upon them, and they dare speak no other
language. Mr Hunt, indeed, is a bold republican,
and tells you the bottom of their meaning. Yet
why should it make the "courage of his Royal Highness
quail, to find himself under this representation,"
which; by our author's favour, is neither dismal,
nor disastrous? Henry IV. escaped this dreadful
machine of the League; I say dreadful, for the
three estates were at that time composed generally
of Guisards, factious, hot-headed, rebellious interested
<span class="pgnm">178</span><a id="page_178" name="page_178"></a>
men. The king in possession was but his brother-in-law,
and at the time publicly his enemy;
for the king of Navarre was then in arms against
him; and yet the sense of common justice, and
the good of his people so prevailed, that he withstood
the project of the states, which he also knew
was levelled at himself; for had the exclusion proceeded,
he had been immediately laid by, and the
lieutenancy of France conferred on Guise; after
which the rebel would certainly have put up his title
for the crown. In the case of his Royal Highness,
only one of the three estates have offered at
the exclusion, and have been constantly opposed by
the other two, and by his majesty. Neither is it
any way probable, that the like will ever be again
attempted; for the fatal consequences, as well as
the illegality of that design, are seen through already
by the people; so that, instead of offering a
justification of an act of exclusion, I have exposed
a rebellious, impious, and fruitless contrivance tending
to it. If we look on the parliament of Paris,
when they were in their right wits, before they
were intoxicated by the League, (at least wholly)
we shall find them addressing to king Henry III.
in another key, concerning the king of Navarre's
succession, though he was at that time, as they
called it, a relapsed heretic. And to this purpose I
will quote a passage out of the journals of Henry III.
so much magnified by my adversaries.</p>

<p>Towards the end of September, 1585, there was
published at Paris a bull of excommunication
against the king of Navarre, and the prince of Cond&eacute;.
The parliament of Paris made their remonstrance
to the king upon it, which was both grave,
and worthy of the place they held, and of the authority
they have in this kingdom; saying for conclusion,
that "their court had found the stile of this
<span class="pgnm">179</span><a id="page_179" name="page_179"></a>
bull so full of innovation, and so distant from the
modesty of ancient Popes, that they could not understand
in it the voice of an Apostle's successor;
forasmuch, as they found not in their records, nor
in the search of all antiquity, that the princes of
France had ever been subject to the justice or jurisdiction
of the Pope, and they could not take it into
consideration, until first he made appear the right
which he pretended in the translation of kingdoms,
established and ordained by Almighty God, before
the name of Pope was heard of in the world." It
is plain by this, that the parliament of Paris acknowledged
an inherent right of succession in the
king of Navarre, though of a contrary religion to
their own. And though, after the duke of Guise's
murder at Blois, the city of Paris revolted from
their obedience to their king, pretending, that he
was fallen from the crown, by reason of that and
other actions, with which they charged him; yet
the sum of all their power to renounce him, and
create the duke of Mayenne lieutenant-general, depended
ultimately on the Pope's authority; which,
as you see, but three years before, they had peremptorily
denied.</p>

<p>The college of Sorbonne began the dance, by their
determination, that the kingly right was forfeited;
and, stripping him of all his dignities, they called
him plain Henry de Valois: after this, says my author,
"sixteen rascals (by which he means the council
of that number) having administered the oath of
government to the duke of Mayenne, to take in
quality of lieutenant-general of the estate and crown
of France, the same ridiculous dignity was confirmed
to him by an imaginary parliament, the
true parliament being detained prisoners, in divers
of the city gaols, and two new seals were ordered
to be immediately made, with this inscription,&mdash;the
<span class="pgnm">180</span><a id="page_180" name="page_180"></a>
Seal of the Kingdom of France." I need not enlarge
on this relation: it is evident from hence, that the
Sorbonnists were the original, and our Schismatics
in England were the copiers of rebellion; that Paris
began, and London followed.</p>

<p>The next lines of my author are, that "a gentleman
of Paris made the duke of Mayenne's picture
to be drawn, with a crown imperial on his head;"
and I have heard of an English nobleman, who has
at this day a picture of old Oliver, with this motto
underneath it,&mdash;<i>Utinam vixeris.</i> All this while, this
cannot be reckoned an act of state, for the deposing
king Henry III., because it was an act of
overt rebellion in the Parisians; neither could
the holding of the three estates at Paris, afterwards,
by the same duke of Mayenne, devolve any right
on him, in prejudice of king Henry IV.; though
those pretended states declared his title void, on the
account of his religion; because those estates could
neither be called nor holden, but by, and under the
authority of, the lawful king. It would take more
time than I have allowed for this Vindication, or I
could easily trace from the French history, what
misfortunes attended France, and how near it was
to ruin, by the endeavours to alter the succession.
For first, it was actually dismembered, the duke of
Merc&aelig;ur setting up a principality in the dutchy of
Bretagne, independent of the crown. The duke of
Mayenne had an evident design to be elected king,
by the favour of the people and the Pope: the
young dukes of Guise and of Nemours aspired, with
the interest of the Spaniards, to be chosen, by their
marriage with the Infanta Isabella. The duke of
Lorraine was for cantling out some part of France,
which lay next his territories; and the duke of Savoy
had, before the death of Henry III., actually
possessed himself of the marquisate of Saluces. But
<span class="pgnm">181</span><a id="page_181" name="page_181"></a>
above all, the Spaniards fomented these civil wars,
in hopes to reduce that flourishing kingdom under
their own monarchy. To as many, and as great mischiefs,
should we be evidently subject, if we should
madly engage ourselves in the like practices of altering
the succession, which our gracious king in his
royal wisdom well foresaw, and has cut up that accursed
project by the roots; which will render the
memory of his justice and prudence immortal and
sacred to future ages, for having not only preserved
our present quiet, but secured the peace of our posterity.</p>

<p>It is clearly manifest, that no act of state passed,
to the exclusion of either the King of Navarre, or of
Henry the fourth, consider him in either of the
two circumstances; but Oracle Hunt, taking this
for granted, would prove <i>&agrave; fortiori</i>, "that if a protestant
prince were actually excluded from a popish
kingdom, then a popish successor is more reasonably
to be excluded from a protestant kingdom; because,"
says he, "a protestant prince is under no
obligation to destroy his popish subjects, but a
popish prince is to destroy his protestant subjects:"
Upon which bare supposition, without farther
proof, he calls him insufferable tyrant, and the
worst of monsters.</p>

<p>Now, I take the matter quite otherwise, and bind
myself to maintain that there is not, nor can be any
obligation, for a king to destroy his subjects of a
contrary persuasion to the established religion of his
country; for, <i>quatenus</i> subjects, of what religion soever
he is infallibly bound to preserve and cherish,
and not to destroy them; and this is the first duty
of a lawful sovereign, as such, antecedent to any
tie or consideration of his religion. Indeed, in
those countries where the Inquisition is introduced,
it goes harder with protestants, and the reason is
<span class="pgnm">182</span><a id="page_182" name="page_182"></a>
manifest; because the protestant religion has not
gotten footing there, and severity is the means to
keep it out; but to make this instance reach England,
our religion must not only be changed, (which
in itself is almost impossible to imagine,) but the
council of Trent received, and the Inquisition admitted,
which many popish countries have rejected.
I forget not the cruelties, which were exercised in
Queen Mary's time against the protestants; neither
do I any way excuse them; but it follows not, that
every popish successor should take example by
them, for every one's conscience of the same religion
is not guided by the same dictates in his government;
neither does it follow, that if one be cruel,
another must, especially when there is a stronger
obligation, and greater interest to the contrary:
for, if a popish king in England should be bound
to destroy his protestant people, I would ask the
question, over whom he meant to reign afterwards?
And how many subjects would be left?</p>

<p>In Queen Mary's time, the protestant religion
had scarcely taken root; and it is reasonable to be
supposed, that she found the number of papists
equalling that of the protestants, at her entrance
to the kingdom; especially if we reckon into the
account those who were the Trimmers of the times;
I mean such, who privately were papists, though
under her protestant predecessor they appeared
otherwise; therefore her difficulties in persecuting
her reformed subjects, were far from being so insuperable
as ours now are, when the strength and
number of the papists is so very inconsiderable.
They, who cast in the church of England as ready
to embrace popery, are either knaves enough to
know they lie, or fools enough not to have considered
the tenets of that church, which are diametrically
<span class="pgnm">183</span><a id="page_183" name="page_183"></a>
opposite to popery; and more so than any
of the sects.</p>

<p>Not to insist on the quiet and security, which
protestant subjects at this day enjoy in some parts
of Germany, under popish princes; where I have
been assured, that mass is said, and a Lutheran sermon
preached in different parts of the same church,
on the same day, without disturbance on either side;
nor on the privileges granted by Henry the fourth
of France to his party, after he had forsaken their
opinions, which they quietly possessed for a long
time after his death.</p>

<p>The French histories are full of examples, manifestly
proving, that the fiercest of their popish
princes have not thought themselves bound to destroy
their protestant subjects; and the several
edicts, granted under them, in favour of the reformed
religion, are pregnant instances of this truth. I
am not much given to quotations, but Davila lies
open for every man to read. Tolerations, and free
exercise of religion, granted more amply in some,
more restrainedly in others, are no sign that those
princes held themselves obliged in conscience to
destroy men of a different persuasion. It will be
said, those tolerations were gained by force of arms.
In the first place, it is no great credit to the protestant
religion, that the protestants in France were
actually rebels; but the truth is, they were only
Geneva protestants, and their opinions were far distant
from those of the church of England, which
teaches passive obedience to all her sons, and not
to propagate religion by rebellion. But it is further
to be considered, that those French kings, though
papists, thought the preservation of their subjects,
and the public peace, were to be considered, before
the gratification of the court of Rome; and though
the number of the papists exceeded that of the
<span class="pgnm">184</span><a id="page_184" name="page_184"></a>
protestants, in the proportion of three to one,
though the protestants were always beaten when
they fought, and though the pope pressed continually
with exhortations and threatenings to extirpate
Calvinism, yet kings thought it enough to continue
in their own religion themselves, without forcing it
upon their subjects, much less destroying them who
professed another. But it will be objected, those
edicts of toleration were not kept on the papists'
side: they would answer, because the protestants
stretched their privileges further than was granted,
and that they often relapsed into rebellion; but
whether or no the protestants were in fault, I leave
history to determine. It is matter of fact, that they
were barbarously massacred, under the protection
of the public faith; therefore, to argue fairly, either
an oath from protestants is not to be taken by a
popish prince; or, if taken, ought inviolably to be
preserved. For, when we oblige ourselves to any
one, it is not his person we so much consider, as
that of the Most High God, who is called to witness
this our action; and it is to Him we are to discharge
our conscience. Neither is there, or can be any tie
on human society, when that of an oath is no more
regarded; which being an appeal to God, He is immediate
judge of it; and chronicles are not silent
how often He has punished perjured kings. The
instance of Vladislaus King of Hungary, breaking
his faith with Amurath the Turk, at the instigation
of Julian the Pope's legate, and his miserable death
ensuing it, shews that even to infidels, much more
to Christians, that obligation ought to be accounted
sacred<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-33">[33]</a>. And I the rather urge this, because it is
<span class="pgnm">185</span><a id="page_185" name="page_185"></a>
an argument taken almost <i>verbatim</i> from a papist,
who accuses Catharine de Medicis for violating her
word given to the protestants during her regency
of France. What securities in particular we have,
that our own religion and liberties would be preserved
though under a popish successor, any one
may inform himself at large in a book lately written
by the reverend and learned doctor Hicks, called
Jovian, in answer to Julian the Apostate<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-34">[34]</a>; in
which that truly Christian author has satisfied all
scruples which reasonable men can make, and proved
that we are in no danger of losing either; and
wherein also, if those assurances should all fail,
(which is almost morally impossible,) the doctrine
of passive obedience is unanswerably demonstrated;
a doctrine delivered with so much sincerity, and
resignation of spirit, that it seems evident the assertor
of it is ready, if there were occasion, to seal
it with his blood.</p>

<p>I have done with mannerly Mr Hunt, who is
only <i>magni nominis umbra</i>; the most malicious, and
withal, the most incoherent ignorant scribbler of the
whole party. I insult not over his misfortunes,
though he has himself occasioned them; and though
I will not take his own excuse, that he is in passion,
<span class="pgnm">186</span><a id="page_186" name="page_186"></a>
I will make a better for him, for I conclude him
cracked; and if he should return to England, am
charitable enough to wish his only prison might be
Bedlam. This apology is truer than that he makes
for me; for writing a play, as I conceive, is not
entering into the Observator's province; neither is it
the Observator's manner to confound truth with
falsehood, to put out the eyes of people, and leave
them without understanding. The quarrel of the
party to him is, that he has undeceived the ignorant,
and laid open the shameful contrivances of the new
vamped Association; that though he is "on the wrong
side of life," as he calls it, yet he pleads not his age
to be <i>emeritus</i>; that, in short, he has left the faction
as bare of arguments, as &AElig;sop's bird of feathers;
and plumed them of all those fallacies and evasions
which they borrowed from jesuits and presbyterians.</p>

<p>Now for my templar and poet in association for
a libel, like the conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter
in a fiery sign. What the one wants in wit, the
other must supply in law. As for malice, their
quotas are indifferently well adjusted; the rough
draught, I take for granted, is the poet's, the finishings
the lawyer's. They begin,&mdash;that in order to one
Mr Friend's commands, one of them went to see
the play. This was not the poet, I am certain; for
nobody saw him there, and he is not of a size to be
concealed. But the mountain, they say, was delivered
of a mouse. I have been gossip to many
such labours of a dull fat scribbler, where the mountain
has been bigger, and the mouse less. The next
sally is on the city-elections, and a charge is brought
against my lord mayor, and the two sheriffs, for excluding
true electors. I have heard, that a Whig
gentleman of the Temple hired a livery-gown, to give
<span class="pgnm">187</span><a id="page_187" name="page_187"></a>
his voice among the companies at Guild-hall; let
the question be put, whether or no he were a true
elector?&mdash;Then their own juries are commended from
several topics; they are the wisest, richest, and most
conscientious: to which is answered, <i>ignoramus</i>.
But our juries give most prodigious and unheard-of
damages. Hitherto there is nothing but boys-play
in our authors: <i>My mill grinds pepper and spice,
your mill grinds rats and mice.</i> They go on,&mdash;"if I
may be allowed to judge;" (as men that do not poetize
may be judges of wit, human nature, and common
decencies;) so then the sentence is begun
with <i>I</i>; there is but one of them puts in for a
judge's place, that is, he in the grey; but presently
it is&mdash;<i>men</i>; two more in buckram would be judges
too. Neither of them, it seems, poetize; that is
true, but both of them are in at rhime doggrel;
witness the song against the bishops, and the Tunbridge
ballad<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-35">[35]</a>. By the way, I find all my scribbling
enemies have a mind to be judges, and chief
barons. Proceed, gentlemen:&mdash;"This play, as I am
informed by some, who have a nearer communication
with the poets and the players, than I have,&mdash;".
<span class="pgnm">188</span><a id="page_188" name="page_188"></a>
Which of the two Sosias is it that now speaks? If
the lawyer, it is true he has but little communication
with the players; if the poet, the players have
but little communication with him; for it is not
long ago, he said to somebody, "By G&mdash;&mdash;, my lord,
those Tory rogues will act none of my plays." Well,
but the accusation,&mdash;that this play was once written
by another, and then it was called the "Parisian
Massacre." Such a play I have heard indeed was
written; but I never saw it<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-36">[36]</a>. Whether this be any
of it or no, I can say no more than for my own
part of it. But pray, who denies the unparalleled
villainy of the papists in that bloody massacre? I
have enquired, why it was not acted, and heard it
<span class="pgnm">189</span><a id="page_189" name="page_189"></a>
was stopt by the interposition of an ambassador,
who was willing to save the credit of his country,
and not to have the memory of an action so barbarous
revived; but that I tempted my friend to
alter it, is a notorious whiggism, to save the broader
word. The "Sicilian Vespers" I have had plotted by
me above these seven years: the story of it I found
under borrowed names in Giraldo Cinthio; but the
rape in my tragedy of "Amboyna" was so like it, that
I forbore the writing. But what had this to do with
protestants? For the massacrers and the massacred
were all papists.</p>

<p>But it is observable, they say, that "though the
massacre could not be acted, as it was first written
against papists, yet when it was turned upon protestants,
it found reception."</p>

<p>Now all is come out; the scandal of the story
turns at last upon the government: that patronizes
popish plays, and forbids protestant<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-37">[37]</a>. Ours is to
<span class="pgnm">190</span><a id="page_190" name="page_190"></a>
be a popish play; why? Because it exposes the
villainy of sectaries and rebels. Prove them first to
be protestants, and see what you will get by it
when you have done. Your party are certainly the
men whom the play attacks, and so far I will help
you; the designs and actions, represented in the
play, are such as you have copied from the League;
for though you have wickedness enough, yet you
wanted the wit to make a new contrivance. But
for shame, while you are carrying on such palpable
villainy, do not assume the name of protestants.
You will tell us, you are friends to the government,
and the king's best subjects; but all the while you
are aspersing both it and him. Who shall be judges,
whether you are friends or not? The government or
you? Have not all rebels always sung the same
song? Was ever thief or murderer fool enough to
plead guilty? For your love and loyalty to the king,
they, who mean him best among you, are no better
subjects than Duke Trinculo; they would be content
he should be viceroy, so they may be viceroys
over him<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-38">[38]</a>.</p>

<p>The next accusation is particular to me,&mdash;"that I,
the said Bayes, would falsely and feloniously have
robbed Nat. Lee of his share in the representation
of &OElig;dipus." Now I am culprit; I writ the first and
third acts of &OElig;dipus, and drew the scenery of the
whole play: whenever I have owned a farther proportion,
<span class="pgnm">191</span><a id="page_191" name="page_191"></a>
let my accusers speak: this was meant
mischievously, to set us two at variance. Who is
the old serpent and Satan now? When my friends
help my barren fancy, I am thankful for it: I do
not use to receive assistance, and afterwards ungratefully
disown it.</p>

<p>Not long after, "exemplary punishment" is due to
me for this most "devilish parallel." It is a devilish one
indeed; but who can help it? If I draw devils like
one another, the fault is in themselves for being so:
I neither made their horns nor claws, nor cloven
feet. I know not what I should have done, unless
I had drawn the devil a handsome proper gentleman,
like the painter in the fable, to have made a
friend of him<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-39">[39]</a>; but I ought to be exemplarily punished
for it: when the devil gets uppermost, I
shall expect it. "In the mean time, let magistrates
(that respect their oaths and office)"&mdash;which words,
you see, are put into a parenthesis, as if (God help
us) we had none such now,&mdash;let them put the law in
execution against lewd scribblers; the mark will be
too fair upon a pillory, for a turnip or a rotten egg
to miss it. But, for my part, I have not malice
enough to wish him so much harm,&mdash;not so much
as to have a hair of his head perish, much less that
one whole side of it should be dismantled. I am no
informer, who writ such a song, or such a libel; if
the dulness betrays him not, he is safe for me. And
may the same dulness preserve him ever from public
justice; it is a sufficient thick mud-wall betwixt
him and law; it is his guardian angel, that
protects him from punishment, because, in spite of
<span class="pgnm">192</span><a id="page_192" name="page_192"></a>
him, he cannot deserve it. It is that which preserves
him innocent when he means most mischief,
and makes him a saint when he intends to be a devil.
He can never offend enough, to need the mercy of
government, for it is beholden to him, that he
writes against it; and he never offers at a satire, but
he converts his readers to a contrary opinion.</p>

<p>Some of the succeeding paragraphs are intended
for very Ciceronian: there the lawyer flourishes in
the pulpit, and the poet stands in socks among the
crowd to hear him. Now for narration, resolution,
calumniation, aggravation, and the whole artillery
of tropes and figures, to defend the proceedings at
Guild-hall. The most minute circumstances of the
elections are described so lively, that a man, who
had not heard he was there in a livery-gown, might
suspect there was a <i>quorum pars magna fui</i> in the
case; and multitudes of electors, just as well qualified
as himself, might give their party the greater
number: but throw back their gilt shillings, which
were told for guineas, and their true sum was considerably
less. Well, there was no rebellion at this time;
therefore, says my adversary, there was no parallel.
It is true there was no rebellion; but who ever told
him that I intended this parallel so far? if the likeness
had been throughout, I may guess, by their
good will to me, that I had never lived to write it.
But, to show his mistake, which I believe wilful,
the play was wholly written a month or two before
the last election of the sheriffs. Yet it seems there
was some kind of prophecy in the case; and, till
the faction gets clear of a riot, a part of the comparison
will hold even there; yet, if he pleases to
remember, there has been a king of England forced
by the inhabitants from his imperial town. It is
true, the son has had better fortune than the father;
but the reason is, that he has now a stronger party
<span class="pgnm">193</span><a id="page_193" name="page_193"></a>
in the city than his enemies; the government of it
is secured in loyal and prudent hands, and the party
is too weak to push their designs farther. "They
rescued not their beloved sheriffs at a time (he tells
you) when they had a most important use of them."
What the importancy of the occasion was, I will not
search: it is well if their own consciences will acquit
them. But let them be never so much beloved,
their adherents knew it was a lawful authority that
sent them to the Tower; and an authority which, to
their sorrow, they were not able to resist: so that,
if four men guarded them without disturbance, and,
to the contempt of their strength, at broad noon-day
and at full exchange-time, it was no more their
honesty to stand looking on with their hands in
their pockets, than it is of a small band of robbers
to let a caravan go by, which is too strong for them
to assault.</p>

<p>After this, I am called, after the old rate, loose
and infamous scribbler; and it is well I escape so
cheap. Bear your good fortune moderately, Mr
Poet; for, as loose and infamous as I am, if I had
written for your party, your pension would have been
cut off as useless. But they must take up with Settle,
and such as they can get: Bartholomew-fair writers<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-40">[40]</a>,
and Bartholemew-close printers; there is a famine
of wit amongst them, they are forced to give unconscionable
rates, and, after all, to have only carrion
for their money.</p>

<p>Then, I am "an ignorant fellow for not knowing
there were no juries in Paris." I do not remember
to have written any such thing; but whoever did,
<span class="pgnm">194</span><a id="page_194" name="page_194"></a>
I am confident it was not his ignorance. Perhaps
he had a mind to bring the case a little nearer
home: If they had not juries in Paris, we had them
from the Normans, who were Frenchmen; and, as
you managed them, we had as good have had none
in London. Let it satisfy you we have them now;
and some of your loose and infamous scribblers may
come to understand it a little better.</p>

<p>The next is, the justification of a noble peer deceased;
the case is known, and I have no quarrel to
his memory: let it sleep; he is now before another
judge. Immediately after, I am said to have intended
an "abuse to the House of Commons;" which is
called by our authors "the most august assembly
of Europe." They are to prove I have abused that
House; but it is manifest they have lessened the
House of Lords, by owning the Commons to be the
"more august assembly."&mdash;"It is an House chosen
(they say) by every protestant who has a considerable
inheritance in England;" which word <i>considerable</i>
signifies forty shillings <i>per annum</i> of free land.
For the interest of the loyal party, so much under-valued
by our authors, they have long ago confessed
in print, that the nobility and gentry have disowned
them; and the yeomanry have at last considered,
<i>queis h&aelig;c consevimus arva</i>? They have had
enough of unlawful and arbitrary power; and know
what an august assembly they had once without a
King and House of Peers.</p>

<p>But now they have me in a burning scent, and
run after me full cry: "Was ever such licence connived
at, in an impious libeller and scribbler, that the
succession, so solemn a matter, that is not fit to be
debated of but in parliament, should be profaned so
far as to be played with on the stage?"</p>

<p>Hold a little, gentlemen, hold a little; (as one of
your fellow citizens says in "The Duke of Guise,")
<span class="pgnm">195</span><a id="page_195" name="page_195"></a>
is it so unlawful for me to argue for the succession
in the right line upon the stage; and is it so very
lawful for Mr Hunt, and the scribblers of your party,
to oppose it in their libels off the stage? Is it
so sacred, that a parliament only is suffered to debate
it, and dare you run it down both in your discourses,
and pamphlets out of parliament? In conscience,
what can you urge against me, which I
cannot return an hundred times heavier on you?
And by the way, you tell me, that to affirm the
contrary to this, is a <i>pr&aelig;munire</i> against the statute
of the 13th of Elizabeth. If such <i>pr&aelig;munire</i> be,
pray, answer me, who has most incurred it? In the
mean time, do me the favour to look into the statute-book,
and see if you can find the statute; you
know yourselves, or you have been told it, that this
statute is virtually repealed, by that of the 1st of
king James, acknowledging his immediate lawful
and undoubted right to this imperial crown, as the
next lineal heir; those last words are an implicit
anti-declaration to the statute in queen Elizabeth,
which, for that reason, is now omitted in our books.
The lawful authority of an House of Commons I
acknowledge; but without fear and trembling, as
my Reflectors would have it. For why should I fear
my representatives? they are summoned to consult
about the public good, and not to frighten those
who chose them. It is for you to tremble, who libel
the supreme authority of the nation. But we
knavish coxcombs and villains are to know, say my
authors, that "a vote is the opinion of that House."
Lord help our understandings, that know not this
without their telling! What Englishman, do you
think, does not honour his representatives, and wish
a parliament void of heat and animosities, to secure
the quiet of the nation? You cite his majesty's declaration
against those that dare trifle with parliaments;
<span class="pgnm">196</span><a id="page_196" name="page_196"></a>
a declaration, by the way, which you endeavoured
not to have read publicly in churches,
with a threatening to those that did it. "But we
still declare (says his majesty) that no irregularities
of parliament shall make us out of love with them."
Are not you unfortunate quoters? why now should
you rub up the remembrance of those irregularities
mentioned in that declaration, which caused, as the
king informs us, its dissolution?</p>

<p>The next paragraph is already answered; it is
only a clumsy commendation of the Duke of Monmouth,
copied after Mr Hunt, and a proof that he
is unlike the Duke of Guise.</p>

<p>After having done my drudgery for me, and having
most officiously proved, that the English duke
is no parallel for the French, which I am sure he is
not, they are next to do their own business, which
is, that I meant a parallel betwixt Henry III. and
our most gracious sovereign. But, as fallacies are
always couched in general propositions, they plead
the whole course of the drama, which, they say,
seems to insinuate my intentions. One may see to
what a miserable shift they are driven, when, for
want of any one instance, to which I challenge
them, they have only to allege, that the play SEEMS
to insinuate it. I answer, it does not seem; which
is a bare negative to a bare affirmative; and then
we are just where we were before. Fat Falstaff
was never set harder by the Prince for a reason,
when he answered, "that, if reasons grew as thick
as blackberries, he would not give one." Well, after
long pumping, lest the lie should appear quite
barefaced, they have found I said, that, at king
Henry's birth, there shone a regal star; so there did
at king Charles the Second's; therefore I have made
a parallel betwixt Henry III. and Charles II. A
<span class="pgnm">197</span><a id="page_197" name="page_197"></a>
very concluding syllogism, if I should answer it no
farther.</p>

<p>Now, let us look upon the play; the words are in
the fourth act. The conjurer there is asking his devil,
"what fortune attended his master, the Guise,
and what the king?" The familiar answers concerning
the king,&mdash;"He cannot be deposed, he may be
killed; a violent fate attends him; but, at his birth,
there shone a regal star."&mdash;<i>Conj.</i> "My master had a
stronger."&mdash;<i>Devil.</i> "No, not a stronger, but more
popular." Let the whole scene, (which is one of the
best in the tragedy, though murdered in the acting)
be read together, and it will be as clear as day light,
that the Devil gave an astrological account of the
French king's <i>horoscope</i>; that the regal star, then
culminating, was the sun in the tenth house, or
mid-heaven; which, <i>c&aelig;teris paribus,</i> is a regal nativity
in that art. The rest of the scene confirms what
I have said; for the Devil has taken the position of
the heavens, or scheme of the world, at the point
of the sun's entrance into Aries. I dispute not here
the truth or lawfulness of that art; but it is usual
with poets, especially the Italians, to mix astrology
in their poems. Chaucer, amongst us, is frequent
in it: but this revolution particularly I have taken
out of Luigi Pulci; and there is one almost the
same in Boiardo's "<i>Orlando Inamorato.</i>" Now, if
these poets knew, that a star were to appear at our
king's birth, they were better prophets than Nostradamus,
who has told us nothing of it. Yet this
they say "is treason with a witness," and one of the
crimes for which they condemned me to be hanged,
drawn and quartered. I find they do not believe
me to be one of their party at the bottom, by their
charitable wishes to me; and am proud enough to
think, I have done them some little mischief, because
they are so desirous to be rid of me. But if
<span class="pgnm">198</span><a id="page_198" name="page_198"></a>
Jack Ketch must needs have the handling of us
poets, let him begin first where he may take the
deepest say<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-41">[41]</a>; let me be hanged, but in my turn; for
I am sure I am neither the fattest scribbler, nor the
worst; I'll be judged by their own party. But, for
all our comforts, the days of hanging are a little out
of date; and I hope there will be no more treason
with a witness or witnesses; for now there is no
more to be got by swearing, and the market is overstocked
besides.</p>

<p>But are you in earnest when you say, I have made
Henry III. "fearful, weak, bloody, perfidious, hypocritical,
and fawning, in the play?" I am sure an
unbiassed reader will find a more favourable image
of him in the tragedy, whatever he was out of it.
You would not have told a lie so shameless, but
that you were resolved to second it with a worse&mdash;that
I made a parallel of that prince. And now it
comes to my turn, pray let me ask you,&mdash;why you
spend three pages and a half in heaping up all the
villainies, true or false, which you can rake together,
to blast his memory? Why is all this pains taken
to expose the person of king Henry III.? Are
you leaguers, or covenanters, or associators? What
has the poor dead man done to nettle you? Were
his rebels your friends or your relations? Were
your Norman ancestors of any of those families,
which were conspirators in the play? I smell a rat
<span class="pgnm">199</span><a id="page_199" name="page_199"></a>
in this business; Henry III. is not taken thus to
task for nothing. Let me tell you, this is little
better than an implicit confession of the parallel I
intended. This gentleman of Valois sticks in your
stomachs; and, though I do not defend his proceedings
in the States, any otherwise than by the
inevitable necessity which caused them, yet acknowledging
his crime does not extenuate their
guilt that forced him to it. It was bad on both
sides, but the revenge was not so wicked as the
treason; for it was a voluntary act of theirs, and a
compelled one of his. The short on't is, he took
a violent course to cut up the Covenant by the
roots; and there is your quarrel to him.</p>

<p>Now for a long-winded panegyric of the king of
Navarre; and here I am sure they are in earnest,
when they take such overpains to prove there is no
likeness where they say I intended it. The hero,
at whom their malice is levelled, does but laugh at
it, I believe; and, amongst the other virtues of
that predecessor, wants neither his justice nor his
clemency, to forgive all the heads of the League, as
fast as they submit. As for obliging them, (which
our author would fain hook in for an ingredient) let
them be satisfied, that no more enemies are to be
bought off with places and preferments; the trial
which has been made in two kings reigns, will
warn the family from so fruitless and dangerous an
expedient. The rest is already answered, in what
I have said to Mr Hunt; but I thank them, by the
way, for their instance of the fellow whom the king
of Navarre had pardoned and done good to, "yet
he would not love him;" for that story reaches
home somewhere.</p>

<p>I must make haste to get out of hearing from
this Billingsgate oratory; and, indeed, to make an
end with these authors, except I could call rogue
<span class="pgnm">200</span><a id="page_200" name="page_200"></a>
and rascal as fast as they. Let us examine the
little reason they produce concerning the Exclusion.</p>

<p>"Did the pope, the clergy, the nobility and commonalty
of France think it reasonable to exclude
a prince for professing a different religion; and will
the papists be angry if the protestants be of the
same opinion? No, sure, they cannot have the impudence."</p>

<p>First, here is the difference of religion taken for
granted, which was never proved on one side, though
in the king of Navarre it was openly professed.
Then the pope, and the three estates of France had
no power to alter the succession, neither did the
king in being consent to it: or afterwards, did the
greater part of the nobility, clergy, and gentry adhere
to the Exclusion, but maintained the lawful
king successfully against it; as we are bound to do
in England, by the oaths of allegiance and supremacy,
made for the benefit of our kings, and their
successors? the objections concerning which oath
are fully answered by Dr Hicks, in his preface to
Jovian; and thither I refer the reader.</p>

<p>They tell us, that what it concerns protestants to
do in that case, enough has been heard by us in
parliament debates.</p>

<p>I answer, that debates coming not by an act to any
issue, conclude, that there is nothing to be done
against a law established, and fundamental of the
monarchy. They dare not infer a right of taking
up arms, by virtue of a debate or vote, and yet they
tacitly insinuate this. I ask them, what it does
concern protestants to do in this case, and whether
they mean anything by that expression? They have
hampered themselves before they were aware; for
they proceed in the very next lines to tell us, they
believe "the crown of England being hereditary,
<span class="pgnm">201</span><a id="page_201" name="page_201"></a>
the next in blood have an undoubted right to succeed,
unless God make them, or they make themselves
uncapable of reigning." So that according
to them, if either of those two impediments shall
happen, then it concerns the protestants of England
to do that something, which, if they had spoken
out, had been direct treason. Here is fine legerdemain
amongst them: they have acknowledged a
vote to be no more than the opinion of an house,
and yet from a debate, which was abortive before
it quickened into a vote, they argue after the old
song, "that there is something more to be done,
which you cannot chuse but guess." In the next
place, there is no such thing as incapacity to be
supposed, in the immediate successor of the crown.
That is, the rightful heir cannot be made uncapable
on any account whatsoever to succeed. It may
please God, that he may be <i>inhabilis</i>, or <i>inidoneus ad
gerendam rempublicam</i>,&mdash;unfit or unable to govern the
kingdom; but this is no impediment to his right
of reigning: he cannot either be excluded or deposed
for such imperfection; for the laws which have provided
for private men in this case, have also made
provision for the sovereign, and for the public; and
the council of state, or the next of blood, is to
administer the kingdom for him. Charles the Sixth
of France, (for I think we have no English examples
which will reach it) forfeited not his kingdom by
his lunacy, though a victorious king of England
was then knocking at his gates; but all things under
his name, and by his authority were managed.
The case is the same, betwixt a king <i>non compos
mentis</i>, and one who is <i>nondum compos mentis</i>;
a distracted or an infant-king. Then the people
cannot incapacitate the king, because he derives
not his right from them, but from God only;
neither can any action, much less opinion of a sovereign,
render him uncapable, for the same reason;
<span class="pgnm">202</span><a id="page_202" name="page_202"></a>
excepting only a voluntary resignation to his immediate
heir, as in the case of Charles the Fifth:
for that of our Richard the Second was invalid, because
forced, and not made to the next successor.</p>

<p>Neither does it follow, as our authors urge, that
an unalterable succession supposes England to be the
king's estate, and the people his goods and chattels
on it. For the preservation of his right destroys
not our propriety, but maintains us in it. He
has tied himself by law, not to invade our possessions;
and we have obliged ourselves as subjects to
him, and all his lawful successors: by which irrevocable
act of ours, both for ourselves and our posterity,
we can no more exclude the successor, than
we can depose the present king. The estate of
England is indeed the king's; and I may safely
grant their supposition, as to the government of
England: but it follows not, that the people are
his goods and chattels on it; for then he might
sell, alienate, or destroy them as he pleased: from
all which he has tied himself by the liberties and
privileges which he has granted us by laws.</p>

<p>There is little else material in this pamphlet: for
to say, "I would insinuate into the king a hatred
to his capital city," is to say, he should hate his
best friends, the last, and the present Lord Mayor,
our two honourable Sheriffs, the Court of Aldermen,
the worthy and loyal Mr Common Serjeant, with
the rest of the officers, who are generally well affected
and who have kept out their factious members
from its government. To say, I would insinuate
a scorn of authority in the city, is, in effect,
to grant the parallel in the play: for the authority
of tumults and seditions is only scorned in it,&mdash;an authority
which they derived not from the crown, but
exercised against it. And for them to confess I exposed
this, is to confess, that London was like Paris.</p>

<p><span class="pgnm">203</span><a id="page_203" name="page_203"></a>
They conclude with a prayer to Almighty God,
in which I therefore believe, the poet did not club.
To libel the king through all the pamphlet, and to
pray for him in the conclusion, is an action of more
prudence in them than of piety. Perhaps they
might hope to be forgiven, as one of their predecessors
was by king James; who, after he had railed
at him abundantly, ended his lampoon with these
two verses:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Now God preserve our king, queen, prince and peers,</p>
<p>And grant the author long may wear his ears<a class="ftnt" href="#Guise_7-42">[42]</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>To take a short review of the whole.&mdash;It is manifest,
that there is no such parallel in the play, as
the faction have pretended; that the story would
not bear one where they have placed it; and that I
could not reasonably intend one, so contrary to the
nature of the play, and so repugnant to the principles
of the loyal party. On the other side, it is
clear that the principles and practices of the public
enemies, have both formerly resembled those of the
League, and continue to hold the same resemblance.
It appears by the outcry of the party before the
play was acted, that they dreaded and foresaw the
bringing of the faction upon the stage: and by the
hasty printing of Mr Hunt's libel, and the Reflections,
before the tragedy was published, that they
were infinitely concerned to prevent any farther
operation of it. It appears from the general consent
of the audiences, that their party were known
to be represented; and themselves owned openly,
by their hissings, that they were incensed at it, as
an object which they could not bear. It is evident
<span class="pgnm">204</span><a id="page_204" name="page_204"></a>
by their endeavours to shift off this parallel from
their side, that their principles are too shameful to be
maintained. It is notorious, that they, and they only,
have made the parallel betwixt the Duke of Guise
and the Duke of Monmouth, and that in revenge
for the manifest likeness they find in the parties
themselves, they have carried up the parallel to the
heads of the parties, where there is no resemblance
at all; under which colour, while they pretend to
advert upon one libel, they set up another. For
what resemblance could they suggest betwixt two
persons so unlike in their descent, the qualities of
their minds, and the disparity of their warlike actions,
if they grant not, that there is a faction here,
which is like that other which was in France? so
that if they do not first acknowledge one common
cause, there is no foundation for a parallel. The
dilemma therefore lies strong upon them; and let
them avoid it if they can,&mdash;that either they must
avow the wickedness of their designs, or disown
the likeness of those two persons. I do further
charge those audacious authors, that they themselves
have made the parallel which they call mine, and
that under the covert of this parallel they have odiously
compared our present king with king Henry
the Third; and farther, that they have forced this
parallel expressly to wound His Majesty in the
comparison: for, since there is a parallel (as they
would have it) it must be either theirs or mine. I
have proved that it cannot possibly be mine: and
in so doing, that it must be theirs by consequence.
Under this shadow all the vices of the French king
are charged by those libellers (by a side-wind) upon
ours; and it is indeed the bottom of their design
to make the king cheap, his royal brother odious,
and to alter the course of the succession.</p>

<p><span class="pgnm">205</span><a id="page_205" name="page_205"></a>
Now, after the malice of this sputtering triumvirate
(Mr Hunt, and the two Reflectors), against
the person and dignity of the king, and against all
that endeavour to serve him (which makes their
hatred to his cause apparent), the very charging of
our play to be a libel, and such a parallel as these
ignoramuses would render it, is almost as great an
affront to His Majesty, as the libellous picture itself,
by which they have exposed him to his subjects.
For it is no longer our parallel, but the king's,
by whose order it was acted, without any shuffling
or importunity from the poets. The tragedy (cried
the faction) is a libel against such and such illustrious
persons. Upon this the play was stopt, examined,
acquitted, and ordered to be brought upon
the stage: not one stroke in it of a resemblance, to
answer the scope and intent of the complaint.
There were some features, indeed, that the illustrious
Mr Hunt and his brace of beagles (the Reflectors)
might see resembling theirs; and no other
parallel either found or meant, but betwixt the
French leaguers and ours: and so far the agreement
held from point to point, as true as a couple of tallies.
But when neither the king, nor my lord chamberlain,
with other honourable persons of eminent
faith, integrity, and understanding, upon a strict
perusal of the papers, could find one syllable to
countenance the calumny; up starts the defender
of the charter, &amp;c. opens his mouth, and says,
"What do ye talk of the king? he's abused, he's
imposed upon. Is my lord chamberlain, and the
scrutineers that succeed him, to tell us, when the
king and the duke of York are abused?" What says
my lord chief baron of Ireland to the business?
What says the livery-man templer? What says Og
the king of Basan to it? "We are men that stand
up for the king's supremacy in all causes, and over
<span class="pgnm">206</span><a id="page_206" name="page_206"></a>
all persons, as well ecclesiastical as civil, next and
immediately under God and the people. We are
for easing His Royal Highness of his title to the
crown, and the cares that attend any such prospect;
and we shall see the king and the Royal Family
paralleled at this rate, and not reflect upon it?"</p>

<p>But to draw to an end. Upon the laying of matters
fairly together, what a king have these balderdash
scribblers given us, under the resemblance of
Henry the Third! How scandalous a character
again, of His Majesty, in telling the world that he
is libelled, and affronted to his face, told on't, pointed
to it; and yet neither he, nor those about him,
can be brought to see or understand it. There
needs no more to expound the meaning of these
people, than to compare them with themselves:
when it will evidently appear, that their lives and
conversations, their writings and their practices,
do all take the same bias; and when they dare
not any longer revile His Majesty or his government
point blank, they have an intention to play
the libellers in masquerade, and do the same thing
in a way of mystery and parable. This is truly the
case of the pretended parallel. They lay their heads
together, and compose the lewdest character of a
prince that can be imagined, and then exhibit that
monster to the people, as the picture of the king
in the "Duke of Guise." So that the libel passes
for current in the multitude, whoever was the author
of it; and it will be but common justice to
give the devil his due. But the truth is, their contrivances
are now so manifest, that their party moulders
both in town and country; for I will not suspect
that there are any of them left in court. Deluded
well-meaners come over out of honesty, and
small offenders out of common discretion or fear.
None will shortly remain with them, but men of
<span class="pgnm">207</span><a id="page_207" name="page_207"></a>
desperate fortunes or enthusiasts: those who dare
not ask pardon, because they have transgressed beyond
it, and those who gain by confusion, as thieves
do by fires: to whom forgiveness were as vain, as
a reprieve to condemned beggars; who must hang
without it, or starve with it.</p>

dissent from my particular friend, for whom I have a very great
respect, and whose writings I extremely admire; and, though I
will not say, his is the best way of writing, yet, I am sure his manner
of writing is much the best that ever was. And I may say of
him, as was said of a celebrated poet, <i>Cui unquam poetarum magis

et f&aelig;clicius debacchatur</i>? His verse is smoother and deeper, his

<p>Such a compliment, from a rival dramatist, could only have been
extracted by previous good offices and kindly countenance. Accordingly
we find, that Dryden, in 1678-9, wrote a prologue to
Shadwell's play, of "The True Widow."</p></li>

<li><a id="Guise_7-4" name="Guise_7-4"></a><p>"The Female Prelate, or Pope Joan," is a bombast, silly performance
of Elkanah Settle; the catastrophe of which consists in
the accouchement of the Pope in the streets of Rome. The aid necessary
in the conclusion of an English tragedy, (usually loudly
called for, but never brought) is of a surgical nature; but here
Lucina was the deity to be implored, and the midwife's assistance
most requisite.</p>

<p>Shadwell's comedy of "The Lancashire Witches," was popular
for many years after the Revolution, chiefly, because the papists
were reflected upon in the character of Teague O'Divelly, an
Irish Priest, the high-church clergy ridiculed under that of Smerk,
and the whole Tory faction generally abused through the play. It
is by no means one of Shadwell's happiest efforts. The introduction
of the witches celebrating their satanical sabbath on the stage,
besides that the scene is very poorly and lamely written, is at variance
with the author's sentiments, as delivered through Sir Edward
Hartfort, "a worthy, hospitable, true English gentleman, of
good understanding and honest principles," who ridicules the belief
in witches at all. A different and totally inconsistent doctrine
is thus to be collected from the action of the piece and the sentiments
expressed by those, whose sentiments are alone marked as
worthy of being attended to. This obvious fault, with many
others, is pointed out in a criticism on the "Lancashire Witches,"
published in the Spectator. The paper is said to have been written
by Hughes, but considerably softened by Addison.</p></li>

<li><a id="Guise_7-6" name="Guise_7-6"></a><p>This single remark is amply sufficient to exculpate Dryden
from having intended any general parallel between Monmouth and
the Duke of Guise. To have produced such a parallel, it would
have been necessary to unite, in one individual, the daring political
courage of Shaftesbury, his capacity of seizing the means to attain
his object, and his unprincipled carelessness of their nature,
with the fine person, chivalrous gallantry, military fame, and
courteous manners of the Duke of Monmouth. Had these talents,
as they were employed in the same cause, been vested in the
same person, the Duke of Guise must have yielded the palm. The
partial resemblance, in one point of their conduct, is stated by our
poet, not to have been introduced as an <i>intended</i> likeness, betwixt
the Duke of Guise, and the Protestant Duke. We may observe,

against the Inner Temple gate. But upon occasion of the signal
of a green ribbon, agreed to be worn in their hats in the days of
secret engagements, like the coats of arms of valiant knights of old,
whereby all the warriors of the society might be distinguished, and
not mistake friends for enemies, they were called also the Green
Ribbon Club. Their seat was in a sort of carrefour, at Chancery-Lane
end, a centre of business and company, most proper for such
anglers of fools. The house was double-balconied in front, as
may be yet seen, for the clubsters to issue forth, in fresco, with
hats and no peruques, pipes in their mouths, merry faces, and
diluted throats, for vocal encouragement of the canaglia below,
at bonfires, on usual and unusual occasions. They admitted all
strangers that were confidingly introduced; for, it was a main end
of their institution to make proselytes, especially of the raw
estated youths newly come to town. This copious society were,
to the faction in and about London, a sort of executive power,
and by correspondence all over England. The resolves of the
more retired councils and ministry of the faction, were brought in
here, and orally insinuated to the company, whether it were lies,
defamations, commendations, projects, &amp;c. and so, like water
diffused, spread over all the town; whereby that which was digested
at the club over night, was, like nourishment, at every assembly,
male and female, the next day. And thus the younglings
tasted of political administration, and took themselves for notable
counsellors." <i>Examen</i>, p. 572. The place of meeting is altered by
Dryden, from the King's-Head, to the Devil-Tavern, either because

were frequent subjects of reproach among the tory authors. In

<li><a id="Guise_7-29" name="Guise_7-29"></a><p>The motto to Hunt's pamphlet.</p></li>

<li><a id="Guise_7-30" name="Guise_7-30"></a><p><i>Tantivi</i> was a cant phrase for furious tories and high-flyers.
In one of College's unlucky strokes of humour, he had invented a
print called <i>Mac Ninny</i>, in which the Duke of York was represented
half-jesuit half-devil; and a parcel of tories, mounted on the
church of England, were driving it at full gallop, <i>tantivy</i>, to Rome.
Hickeringill's poem, called "The Mushroom," written against our
author's "Hind and Panther," is prefaced by an epistle to the tories
and tantivies.</p></li>

<li><a id="Guise_7-31" name="Guise_7-31"></a><p>This passage is inaccurately quoted. Mr Hunt wrote, "Such
monsters as Theseus and Hercules <i>are</i>, renowned throughout all
ages for destroying." The learned gentleman obviously meant
that Dryden's heroes (whom he accounted tyrants) resembled not
the demi-gods, but the monsters whom they destroyed. But the
comma is so unhappily placed after <i>are</i>, as to leave the sense capable
of the malicious interpretation which Dryden has put upon
it.</p></li>

<li><a id="Guise_7-32" name="Guise_7-32"></a><p>Shadwell, as he resembled Ben Jonson in extreme corpulence,
and proposed him for the model of dramatic writing, seems to have
affected the coarse and inelegant debauchery of his prototype. He
lived chiefly in taverns, was a gross sensualist in his habits, and brutal
in his conversation. His fine gentlemen all partake of their parent's
grossness and vulgarity; they usually open their dialogue, by complaining
of the effects of last night's debauch. He is probably the
only author, who ever chose for his heroes a set of riotous bloods,
or <i>scowerers</i>, as they were then termed, and expected the public
should sympathise in their brutal orgies. True it is, that the heroes
are <i>whig</i> scowerers; and, whilst breaking windows, stabbing
watchmen, and beating passengers, do not fail to express a due
zeal for the Protestant religion, and the liberty of the subject.
Much of the interest also turns, it must be allowed, upon the Protestant
scowerers aforesaid baffling and beating, without the least
provocation, a set of inferior scowerers, who were Jacobites at
least, if not Papists. Shadwell is thus described in the "Sessions
of the Poets:"</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Next into the crowd Tom Shadwell does wallow,</p>
<p>And swears by his guts, his paunch, and his tallow,</p>
<p>'Tis he that alone best pleases the age,</p>
<p>Himself and his wife have supported the stage.</p>
<p>Apollo, well pleased with so bonny a lad,</p>
<p>To oblige him, he told him he should be huge glad,</p>
<p>Had he half so much wit as he fancied he had.</p>
<p>However, to please so jovial a wit,</p>
<p>And to keep him in humour, Apollo thought fit</p>
<p>To bid him drink on, and keep his old trick</p>
<p>Of railing at poets&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>Those, who consult the full passage, will see good reason to
think Dryden's censure on Shadwell's brutality by no means too
severe.</p></li>

<li><a id="Guise_7-33" name="Guise_7-33"></a><p>In 1444, Ladislaus king of Hungary, in breach of a treaty
solemnly sworn upon the gospel, invaded Bulgaria, at the instigation
of the Cardinal Legate. He was slain, and his army totally
routed in the bloody battle of Warna, where ten thousand Christians
fell before the janissaries of Amurath II. It is said, that while
the battle remained undecided, the sultan displayed the solemn
treaty, and invoked the God of truth, and the blessed name of
Jesus, to revenge the impious infidelity of the Hungarian. This
battle would have laid Hungary under the Turkish yoke, had it not
been for the exploits of John Corvinus Huniades, the white knight
of Walachia, and the more dubious prowess of the famous John
Castriot, king of Epirus.</p></li>

<li><a id="Guise_7-36" name="Guise_7-36"></a><p>The "Massacre of Paris" appears to have been written by Lee,
during the time of the Popish plot, and if then brought out, the
subject might have been extravagantly popular. It would appear
it was suppressed at the request of the French ambassador. Several
speeches, and even a whole scene seem to have been transplanted
to the "Duke of Guise," which were afterwards replaced, when
the Revolution rendered the "Massacre of Paris," again a popular
topic. There were, among others, the description of the meeting
of Alva and the queen mother at Bayonne; the sentiments expressed
concerning the assassination of C&aelig;sar, and especially the whole
quarrelling scene between Guise and Grillon, which, in the "Massacre
of Paris," passes between Guise and the admiral Chastillon.
In the preface to the "Princess of Cleves," which was acted in
1689, Lee gives the following account of the transposition of these
passages. "The Duke of Guise, who was notorious for a bolder
fault, has wrested two whole scenes from the original, (the Massacre
just before mentioned,) which, after the vacation, he will be
forced to pay. I was, I confess, through indignation, forced to
limb my own child, which time, the true cure for all maladies and
injustice, has set together again. The play cost me much pains,
the story is true, and, I hope, the object will display treachery in
its own colours. But this farce, comedy, tragedy, or mere play,
was a revenge for the refusal of the other." This last sentence alludes
to the suppression of the "Massacre of Paris," which, according
to the author's promise, appeared with all its appurtenances
restored in 1690, the year following.</p></li>

<li><a id="Guise_7-37" name="Guise_7-37"></a><p>When the days of Whiggish prosperity shone forth, Shadwell did

<h3 class="chap">ALBION AND ALBANIUS.</h3>

<p>This opera, like the play which precedes it, had an avowed political
object. It was intended to celebrate the victory of the
crown over its opponents, or, as our author would have expressed
it, of loyalty over sedition and insurrection. The events, which
followed the Restoration, are rapidly, but obviously and distinctly,
traced down to the death of Charles, and the quiet accession of
his brother, who, after all the storms which had threatened to blast
his prospects, found himself enabled to mount the throne, with ease
sufficient to encourage him to the measures which precipitated him
from that elevation. The leading incidents of the busy and intriguing
reign of Charles II. are successively introduced in the following
order. The city of London is discovered occupied by the republicans
and fanatics, depicted under the allegorical personages Democracy
and Zeal. General Monk, as Archon, charms the factions
to sleep, and the Restoration is emblematized by the arrival
of Charles, and the Duke of York, under the names of Albion and
Albanius. The second act opens with a council of the fiends,
where the popish plot is hatched, and Democracy and Zeal are dismissed,
to propagate it upon earth, with Oates, the famous witness,
in their train. The next entry presents Augusta, or London, stung
by a snake, to intimate the revival of the popular faction in the
metropolis. Democracy and Zeal, under the disguise of Patriotism
and Religion, insinuate themselves into the confidence of the
city, and are supposed to foment the parliamentary opposition,
which, ending on the bill of exclusion, rendered it necessary, that
the Duke of York should leave the kingdom. We have then, in
allegorical representation, the internal feuds of the parties, which,
from different causes, opposed the crown. The adherents of Monmouth,
and the favourers of republican tenets, are represented as
disputing with each other, until the latter, by the flight of Shaftesbury,
<span class="pgnm">212</span><a id="page_212" name="page_212"></a>
obtains a final ascendancy. In the mean while, Charles, or
Albion, has recourse to the advice of Proteus; under which emblem
an evil minded whig might suppose Halifax, and the party
of Trimmers, to be represented; actuated by whose versatile, and
time-serving politics, Charles gave way to each wave, but remained
buoyant amid the tempest. The Rye-house plot is then presented
in allegory,&mdash;an unfit subject for exultation, since the dark
intrigues of the interior conspirators were made the instruments of
the fall of Sidney and Russell. The return of the Duke of York,
with his beautiful princess, and the rejoicings which were supposed
to take place, in heaven and earth, upon Charles' attaining the pinnacle
of uncontrolled power, was originally the intended termination
of the opera; which, as first written, consisted of only one act, introductory
to the drama of "King Arthur." But the eye and the ear of
Charles were never to be regaled by this flattering representation: he
died while the opera was in rehearsal. A slight addition, as the author
has himself informed us, adapted the conclusion of his piece to
this new and unexpected event. The apotheosis of Albion, and
the succession of Albanius to the uncontrouled domination of a
willing people, debased by circumstances expressing an unworthy
triumph over deceased foes, was substituted as the closing scene.
Altered as it was, to suit the full-blown fortune of James, an
ominous fatality attended these sugared scenes, which were to present
the exulting recapitulation of his difficulties and triumph.
While the opera was performing, for the sixth time only, news arrived
that Monmouth had landed in the west, the audience dispersed,
and the players never attempted to revive a play, which
seemed to be of evil augury to the crown.</p>

<p>Our author appears to have found it difficult to assign a name for
this performance, which was at once to address itself to the eye,
the ear, and the understanding. The ballad-opera, since invented,
in which part is sung, part acted and spoken, comes nearest
to its description. The plot of the piece contains nothing brilliantly
ingenious: the deities of Greece and Rome had been long
hacknied machines in the masks and operas of the sixteenth century;
and it required little invention to paint the duchess of York
as Venus, or to represent her husband protected by Neptune, and
Charles consulting with Proteus. But though the device be trite,
the lyrical diction of the opera is most beautifully sweet and flowing.
The reader finds none of these harsh inversions, and awkward
constructions, by which ordinary poets are obliged to screw their
verses into the fetters of musical time. Notwithstanding the
obstacles stated by Dryden himself, every line seems to flow
in its natural and most simple order; and where the music required
repetition of a line, or a word, the iteration seems to improve the
<span class="pgnm">213</span><a id="page_213" name="page_213"></a>
sense and poetical effect. Neither is the piece deficient in the
higher requisites of lyric poetry. When music is to be "married
to immortal verse," the poet too commonly cares little with how
indifferent a yoke-mate he provides her. But Dryden, probably
less from a superior degree of care, than from that divine impulse
which he could not resist, has hurried along in the full stream of
real poetry. The description of the desolation of London, at the
opening of the piece, the speech of Augusta, in act second, and
many other passages, fully justify this encomium.</p>

<p>The music of the piece was entrusted to Louis Grabut, or
Grabu, the master of the king's band, whom Charles, French in
his politics, his manners, and his taste, preferred to the celebrated
Purcell. "Purcell, however," says an admirable judge,
"having infinitely more fancy, and, indeed, harmonical resources,
than the Frenchified Tuscan, his predecessor, now offered far
greater pleasure and amusement to a liberal lover of music, than
can be found, not only in the productions of Cambert and Grabu,
whom Charles II., and, to flatter his majesty, Dryden, patronised
in preference to Purcell, but in all the noisy monotony of the
rhapsodist of Quinault."&mdash;<i>Burney's History of Music</i>, Vol. III.
p. 500.</p>

<p>It seems to be generally admitted, that the music of "Albion
and Albanius" was very indifferent. From the preface, as well as
the stage directions, it appears that a vast expence was incurred,
in shew, dress, and machinery. Downes informs us, that, owing
to the interruption of the run of the piece in the manner already
mentioned, the half of the expence was never recovered, and the
theatre was involved considerably in debt.&mdash;<i>Rosc. Anglic.</i> p. 40.
The whigs, against whom the satire was levelled, the rival dramatists
of the day, and the favourers of the English school of music,
united in triumphing in its downfall<a class="ftnt" href="#Albio_1-1">[1]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pgnm">214</span><a id="page_214" name="page_214"></a>
Mr Luttrell's manuscript note has fixed the first representation
of "Albion and Albanius" to the 3d of June, 1685; and the laudable
accuracy of Mr Malone has traced its sixth night to Saturday
the 13th of the same month, when an express brought the news
<span class="pgnm">215</span><a id="page_215" name="page_215"></a>
of Monmouth's landing. The opera was shortly after published.
In 1687 Grabut published the music, with a dedication to James
II.<a class="ftnt" href="#Albio_1-2">[2]</a></p>

<h3 class="chap">THE
PREFACE.</h3>

<p>If wit has truly been defined, "a propriety of
thoughts and words,<a class="ftnt" href="#Albio_2-1">[1]</a>" then that definition will extend
to all sorts of poetry; and, among the rest, to
this present entertainment of an opera. Propriety
of thought is that fancy which arises naturally
from the subject, or which the poet adapts to it;
propriety of words is the clothing of those thoughts
with such expressions as are naturally proper to
them; and from both these, if they are judiciously
performed, the delight of poetry results. An opera
is a poetical tale, or fiction, represented by vocal
and instrumental music, adorned with scenes, machines,
and dancing. The supposed persons of this
musical drama are generally supernatural, as gods,
and goddesses, and heroes, which at least are descended
from them, and are in due time to be
adopted into their number. The subject, therefore,
being extended beyond the limits of human nature,
admits of that sort of marvellous and surprising
conduct, which is rejected in other plays. Human
<span class="pgnm">217</span><a id="page_217" name="page_217"></a>
impossibilities are to be received as they are in
faith; because, where gods are introduced, a supreme
power is to be understood, and second causes
are out of doors; yet propriety is to be observed
even here. The gods are all to manage their peculiar
provinces; and what was attributed by the
heathens to one power, ought not to be performed
by any other. Ph&oelig;bus must foretel, Mercury must
charm with his caduceus, and Juno must reconcile
the quarrels of the marriage-bed; to conclude, they
must all act according to their distinct and peculiar
characters. If the persons represented were to speak
upon the stage, it would follow, of necessity, that
the expressions should be lofty, figurative, and majestical:
but the nature of an opera denies the frequent
use of these poetical ornaments; for vocal
music, though it often admits a loftiness of sound,
yet always exacts an harmonious sweetness; or, to
distinguish yet more justly, the recitative part of
the opera requires a more masculine beauty of expression
and sound. The other, which, for want of
a proper English word, I must call the <i>songish part</i>,
must abound in the softness and variety of numbers;
its principal intention being to please the
hearing, rather than to gratify the understanding.
It appears, indeed, preposterous at first sight, that
rhyme, on any consideration, should take place of
reason; but, in order to resolve the problem, this
fundamental proposition must be settled, that the
first inventors of any art or science, provided they
have brought it to perfection, are, in reason, to give
laws to it; and, according to their model, all after-undertakers
are to build. Thus, in epic poetry, no
man ought to dispute the authority of Homer, who
gave the first being to that masterpiece of art, and
endued it with that form of perfection in all its
parts, that nothing was wanting to its excellency.
Virgil therefore, and those very few who have succeeded
<span class="pgnm">218</span><a id="page_218" name="page_218"></a>
him, endeavoured not to introduce, or innovate,
any thing in a design already perfected, but
imitated the plan of the inventor; and are only so
far true heroic poets, as they have built on the foundations
of Homer. Thus, Pindar, the author of
those Odes, which are so admirably restored by Mr
Cowley in our language, ought for ever to be the
standard of them; and we are bound, according to
the practice of Horace and Mr Cowley, to copy him.
Now, to apply this axiom to our present purpose,
whosoever undertakes the writing of an opera,
which is a modern invention, though built indeed
on the foundation of ethnic worship, is obliged to
imitate the design of the Italians, who have not only
invented, but brought to perfection, this sort of
dramatic musical entertainment. I have not been
able, by any search, to get any light, either of the
time when it began, or of the first author; but I
have probable reasons, which induce me to believe,
that some Italians, having curiously observed the
gallantries of the Spanish Moors at their zambras,
or royal feasts, where music, songs, and dancing,
were in perfection, together with their machines,
which are usual at their <i>sortija</i>, or running at the
ring, and other solemnities, may possibly have refined
upon those moresque divertisements, and produced
this delightful entertainment, by leaving out
the warlike part of the carousals, and forming a
poetical design for the use of the machines, the
songs, and dances. But however it began, (for this
is only conjectural,) we know, that, for some centuries,
the knowledge of music has flourished principally
in Italy, the mother of learning and of arts<a class="ftnt" href="#Albio_2-2">[2]</a>;
that poetry and painting have been there restored,
<span class="pgnm">219</span><a id="page_219" name="page_219"></a>
and so cultivated by Italian masters, that all Europe
has been enriched out of their treasury; and
the other parts of it, in relation to those delightful
arts, are still as much provincial to Italy, as they
were in the time of the Roman empire. Their first
operas seem to have been intended for the celebration
of the marriages of their princes, or for the
magnificence of some general time of joy; accordingly,
the expences of them were from the purse of
the sovereign, or of the republic, as they are still
practised at Venice, Rome, and at other places, at
their carnivals. Savoy and Florence have often used
them in their courts, at the weddings of their dukes;
and at Turin particularly, was performed the "Pastor
Fido," written by the famous Guarini, which is a
pastoral opera made to solemnise the marriage of a
Duke of Savoy. The prologue of it has given the
design to all the French; which is a compliment to
the sovereign power by some god or goddess; so
that it looks no less than a kind of embassy from
heaven to earth. I said in the beginning of this
preface, that the persons represented in operas are
generally gods, goddesses, and heroes descended
from them, who are supposed to be their peculiar
care; which hinders not, but that meaner persons
may sometimes gracefully be introduced, especially
if they have relation to those first times, which
poets call the Golden Age; wherein, by reason of
their innocence, those happy mortals were supposed
to have had a more familiar intercourse with superior
beings; and therefore shepherds might reasonably
be admitted, as of all callings the most innocent,
the most happy, and who, by reason of the
spare time they had, in their almost idle employment,
had most leisure to make verses, and to be
in love; without somewhat of which passion, no
opera can possibly subsist.</p>

<p>It is almost needless to speak any thing of that
<span class="pgnm">220</span><a id="page_220" name="page_220"></a>
noble language, in which this musical drama was
first invented and performed. All, who are conversant
in the Italian, cannot but observe, that it is the
softest, the sweetest, the most harmonious, not only
of any modern tongue, but even beyond any of
the learned. It seems indeed to have been invented
for the sake of poetry and music; the vowels are
so abounding in all words, especially in terminations
of them, that, excepting some few monosyllables,
the whole language ends in them. Then
the pronunciation is so manly, and so sonorous, that
their very speaking has more of music in it than
Dutch poetry and song. It has withal derived, so
much copiousness and eloquence from the Greek
and Latin, in the composition of words, and the formation
of them, that if, after all, we must call it
barbarous, it is the most beautiful and most learned
of any barbarism in modern tongues; and we may,
at least, as justly praise it, as Pyrrhus did the Roman
discipline and martial order, that it was of barbarians,
(for so the Greeks called all other nations,)
but had nothing in it of barbarity. This language
has in a manner been refined and purified from the
Gothic ever since the time of Dante, which is
above four hundred years ago; and the French,
who now cast a longing eye to their country, are
not less ambitious to possess their elegance in poetry
and music; in both which they labour at impossibilities.
It is true, indeed, they have reformed
their tongue, and brought both their prose and
poetry to a standard; the sweetness, as well as the
purity, is much improved, by throwing off the unnecessary
consonants, which made their spelling tedious
and their pronunciation harsh: but, after all,
as nothing can be improved beyond its own <i>species</i>,
or farther than its original nature will allow; as an
ill voice, though ever so thoroughly instructed in
the rules of music, can never be brought to sing
<span class="pgnm">221</span><a id="page_221" name="page_221"></a>
harmoniously, nor many an honest critic ever arrive
to be a good poet; so neither can the natural
harshness of the French, or their perpetual ill accent,
be ever refined into perfect harmony like the
Italian. The English has yet more natural disadvantages
than the French; our original Teutonic,
consisting most in monosyllables, and those incumbered
with consonants, cannot possibly be freed
from those inconveniencies. The rest of our words,
which are derived from the Latin chiefly, and the
French, with some small sprinklings of Greek, Italian,
and Spanish, are some relief in poetry, and help
us to soften our uncouth numbers; which, together
with our English genius, incomparably beyond
the trifling of the French, in all the nobler parts of
verse, will justly give us the pre-eminence. But,
on the other hand, the effeminacy of our pronunciation,
(a defect common to us and to the Danes,)
and our scarcity of female rhymes, have left the
advantage of musical composition for songs, though
not for recitative, to our neighbours.</p>

<p>Through these difficulties I have made a shift to
struggle in my part of the performance of this opera;
which, as mean as it is, deserves at least a pardon,
because it has attempted a discovery beyond
any former undertaker of our nation; only remember,
that if there be no north-east passage to be
found, the fault is in nature, and not in me; or,
as Ben Jonson tells us in "The Alchymist," when
projection had failed, and the glasses were all broken,
there was enough, however, in the bottoms of
them, to cure the itch; so I may thus be positive,
that if I have not succeeded as I desire, yet there is
somewhat still remaining to satisfy the curiosity, or
itch of sight and hearing. Yet I have no great reason
to despair; for I may, without vanity, own
some advantages, which are not common to every
writer; such as are the knowledge of the Italian
<span class="pgnm">222</span><a id="page_222" name="page_222"></a>
and French language, and the being conversant
with some of their best performances in this kind;
which have furnished me with such variety of measures
as have given the composer, Monsieur Grabut,
what occasions he could wish, to shew his extraordinary
talent in diversifying the recitative, the
lyrical part, and the chorus; in all which, not to attribute
any thing to my own opinion, the best judges
and those too of the best quality, who have
honoured his rehearsals with their presence, have
no less commended the happiness of his genius than
his skill. And let me have the liberty to add one
thing, that he has so exactly expressed my sense in
all places where I intended to move the passions,
that he seems to have entered into my thoughts,
and to have been the poet as well as the composer.
This I say, not to flatter him, but to do him right;
because amongst some English musicians, and their
scholars, who are sure to judge after them, the imputation
of being a Frenchman is enough to make
a party, who maliciously endeavour to decry him.
But the knowledge of Latin and Italian poets, both
which he possesses, besides his skill in music, and
his being acquainted with all the performances of
the French operas, adding to these the good sense
to which he is born, have raised him to a degree
above any man, who shall pretend to be his rival
on our stage. When any of our countrymen excel
him, I shall be glad, for the sake of old England,
to be shewn my error; in the mean time, let virtue
be commended, though in the person of a stranger<a class="ftnt" href="#Albio_2-3">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>If I thought it convenient, I could here discover
some rules which I have given to myself in writing
<span class="pgnm">223</span><a id="page_223" name="page_223"></a>
of an opera in general, and of this opera in particular;
but I consider, that the effect would only
be, to have my own performance measured by the
laws I gave; and, consequently, to set up some
little judges, who, not understanding thoroughly,
would be sure to fall upon the faults, and not to
acknowledge any of the beauties; an hard measure,
which I have often found from false critics. Here,
therefore, if they will criticise, they shall do it out
of their own <i>fond</i>; but let them first be assured
that their ears are nice; for there is neither writing
nor judgment on this subject without that good
quality. It is no easy matter, in our language, to
make words so smooth, and numbers so harmonious,
that they shall almost set themselves. And
yet there are rules for this in nature, and as great a
certainty of quantity in our syllables, as either in
the Greek or Latin: but let poets and judges understand
those first, and then let them begin to
study English. When they have chewed a while
upon these preliminaries, it may be they will scarce
adventure to tax me with want of thought and elevation
of fancy in this work; for they will soon be
satisfied, that those are not of the nature of this
sort of writing. The necessity of double rhimes,
and ordering of the words and numbers for the
sweetness of the voice, are the main hinges on
which an opera must move; and both of these are
without the compass of any art to teach another to
perform, unless nature, in the first place, has done
her part, by enduing the poet with that nicety of
hearing, that the discord of sounds in words shall
as much offend him, as a seventh in music would a
good composer. I have therefore no need to make
excuses for meanness of thought in many places:
the Italians, with all the advantages of their language,
are continually forced upon it, or, rather,
affect it. The chief secret is the choice of words;
<span class="pgnm">224</span><a id="page_224" name="page_224"></a>
and, by this choice, I do not here mean elegancy of
expression, but propriety of sound, to be varied according
to the nature of the subject. Perhaps a
time may come when I may treat of this more largely,
out of some observations which I have made
from Homer and Virgil, who, amongst all the poets,
only understood the art of numbers, and of that
which was properly called <i>rhythmus</i> by the ancients.</p>

<p>The same reasons, which depress thought in an
opera, have a stronger effect upon the words, especially
in our language; for there is no maintaining
the purity of English in short measures, where the
rhime returns so quick, and is so often female, or
double rhime, which is not natural to our tongue,
because it consists too much of monosyllables, and
those, too, most commonly clogged with consonants;
for which reason I am often forced to coin
new words, revive some that are antiquated, and
botch others; as if I had not served out my time in
poetry, but was bound apprentice to some doggrel
rhimer, who makes songs to tunes, and sings them
for a livelihood. It is true, I have not been often
put to this drudgery; but where I have, the words
will sufficiently shew, that I was then a slave to the
composition, which I will never be again: it is my
part to invent, and the musician's to humour that
invention. I may be counselled, and will always
follow my friend's advice where I find it reasonable,
but will never part with the power of the militia<a class="ftnt" href="#Albio_2-4">[4]</a>.</p>

<p>I am now to acquaint my reader with somewhat
more particular concerning this opera, after having
begged his pardon for so long a preface to so short
a work. It was originally intended only for a prologue
to a play of the nature of "The Tempest;"
<span class="pgnm">225</span><a id="page_225" name="page_225"></a>
which is a tragedy mixed with opera, or a drama,
written in blank verse, adorned with scenes, machines,
songs, and dances, so that the fable of it
is all spoken and acted by the best of the comedians;
the other part of the entertainment to be
performed by the same singers and dancers who
were introduced in this present opera. It cannot
properly be called a play, because the action of it
is supposed to be conducted sometimes by supernatural
means, or magic; nor an opera, because the
story of it is not sung.&mdash;But more of this at its proper
time.&mdash;But some intervening accidents having
hitherto deferred the performance of the main design,
I proposed to the actors, to turn the intended
Prologue into an entertainment by itself, as you
now see it, by adding two acts more to what I had
already written. The subject of it is wholly allegorical;
and the allegory itself so very obvious, that
it will no sooner be read than understood. It is
divided, according to the plain and natural method
of every action, into three parts. For even Aristotle
himself is contented to say simply, that in all
actions there is a beginning, a middle, and an end;
after which model all the Spanish plays are built.</p>

<p>The descriptions of the scenes, and other decorations
of the stage, I had from Mr Betterton, who
has spared neither for industry, nor cost, to make
this entertainment perfect, nor for invention of the
ornaments to beautify it.</p>

<p>To conclude, though the enemies of the composer
are not few, and that there is a party formed
against him of his own profession, I hope, and am
persuaded, that this prejudice will turn in the end
to his advantage. For the greatest part of an audience
is always uninterested, though seldom knowing;
and if the music be well composed, and well
performed, they, who find themselves pleased, will
<span class="pgnm">226</span><a id="page_226" name="page_226"></a>
be so wise as not to be imposed upon, and fooled
out of their satisfaction. The newness of the undertaking
is all the hazard. When operas were
first set up in France, they were not followed over
eagerly; but they gained daily upon their hearers,
till they grew to that height of reputation, which
they now enjoy. The English, I confess, are not
altogether so musical as the French; and yet they
have been pleased already with "The Tempest," and
some pieces that followed, which were neither much
better written, nor so well composed as this. If it
finds encouragement, I dare promise myself to
mend my hand, by making a more pleasing fable.
In the mean time, every loyal Englishman cannot
but be satisfied with the moral of this, which so
plainly represents the double restoration of His Sacred
Majesty.</p>

<h3 class="nomarg">POSTSCRIPT.</h3>

<p>This preface being wholly written before the death
of my late royal master, (<i>quem semper acerbum,
semper honoratum, sic dii voluistis, habebo</i>) I have
now lately reviewed it, as supposing I should find
many notions in it, that would require correction
on cooler thoughts. After four months lying by
me, I looked on it as no longer mine, because I had
wholly forgotten it; but I confess with some satisfaction,
and perhaps a little vanity, that I found
myself entertained by it; my own judgment was
new to me, and pleased me when I looked on it as
another man's. I see no opinion that I would retract
or alter, unless it be, that possibly the Italians
went not so far as Spain, for the invention of their
operas. They might have it in their own country;
and that by gathering up the shipwrecks of the
<span class="pgnm">227</span><a id="page_227" name="page_227"></a>
Athenian and Roman theatres, which we know
were adorned with scenes, music, dances, and machines,
especially the Grecian. But of this the
learned Monsieur Vossius, who has made our nation
his second country, is the best, and perhaps the only
judge now living. As for the opera itself, it was
all composed, and was just ready to have been performed,
when he, in honour of whom it was principally
made, was taken from us.</p>

<p>He had been pleased twice or thrice to command,
that it should be practised before him, especially
the first and third acts of it; and publicly declared
more than once, that the composition and choruses
were more just, and more beautiful, than any he had
heard in England. How nice an ear he had in music,
is sufficiently known; his praise therefore has
established the reputation of it above censure, and
made it in a manner sacred. It is therefore humbly
and religiously dedicated to his memory.</p>

<p>It might reasonably have been expected that his
death must have changed the whole fabric of the
opera, or at least a great part of it. But the design
of it originally was so happy, that it needed no alteration,
properly so called; for the addition of
twenty or thirty lines in the apotheosis of Albion,
has made it entirely of a piece, This was the only
way which could have been invented, to save it from
botched ending; and it fell luckily into my imagination;
as if there were a kind of fatality even in
the most trivial things concerning the succession:
a change was made, and not for the worse, without
the least confusion or disturbance; and those
very causes, which seemed to threaten us with troubles,
conspired to produce our lasting happiness.</p>

FRONTISPIECE.</h3>

<p>The curtain rises, and a new frontispiece is seen,
joined to the great pilasters, which are seen on each
side of the stage: on the flat of each basis is a shield,
adorned with gold; in the middle of the shield, on
one side, are two hearts, a small scroll of gold over
them, and an imperial crown over the scroll; on
the other hand, in the shield, are two quivers full
of arrows saltyre, &amp;c.; upon each basis stands a
figure bigger than the life; one represents Peace,
with a palm in one, and an olive branch in the
other hand; the other Plenty, holding a cornucopia,
and resting on a pillar. Behind these figures
are large columns of the Corinthian order, adorned
with fruit and flowers: over one of the figures on
the trees is the king's cypher; over the other, the
queen's: over the capitals, on the cornice, sits a figure
on each side; one represents Poetry, crowned
with laurel, holding a scroll in one hand, the other
with a pen in it, and resting on a book; the other,
Painting, with a pallet and pencils, &amp;c.: on the
sweep of the arch lies one of the Muses, playing on
a bass-viol; another of the Muses, on the other
side, holding a trumpet in one hand, and the other
on a harp. Between these figures, in the middle
of the sweep of the arch, is a very large pannel in
a frame of gold; in this pannel is painted, on one
side, a Woman, representing the city of London,
<span class="pgnm">232</span><a id="page_232" name="page_232"></a>
leaning her head on her hand in a dejected posture,
showing her sorrow and penitence for her offences;
the other hand holds the arms of the city, and a mace
lying under it: on the other side is a figure of
the Thames, with his legs shackled, and leaning on
an empty urn: behind these are two imperial figures;
one representing his present majesty; and
the other the queen: by the king stands Pallas, (or
wisdom and valour,) holding a charter for the city,
the king extending his hand, as raising her drooping
head, and restoring her to her ancient honour
and glory: over the city are the envious devouring
Harpies flying from the face of his majesty: By the
queen stand the Three Graces, holding garlands of
flowers, and at her feet Cupids bound, with their
bows and arrows broken, the queen pointing with
her sceptre to the river, and commanding the Graces
to take off their fetters. Over the king, in a scroll,
is this verse of Virgil,</p>

<p><i>The Curtain rises, and there appears on either side
of the Stage, next to the Frontispiece, a Statue on
Horseback of Gold, on Pedestals of Marble, enriched
with Gold, and bearing the Imperial Arms of England.
One of these Statues is taken from that of the
late King at Charing-cross; the other from that figure
of his present Majesty (done by that noble Artist,
Mr. Gibbons) at Windsor.</i></p>

<p><i>The Scene is a Street of Palaces, which lead to the
Front of the Royal-Exchange; the great Arch is open,
and the view is continued through the open part of the

to as much of the Street beyond, as could possibly be
taken.</i></p>

<p><i>On the side of Augusta's Couch are painted towers

commonwealth's men. The flight of Shaftesbury, whose bustling
and politic brain had rendered him the sole channel of communication

in one common design, threw loose all connection between them;

<li><a id="Albio_4-9" name="Albio_4-9"></a><p>The allegory of the one-eyed Archer, and the fire arising betwixt
him and Albion, will be made evident by the following extracts
from Sprat's history of the Conspiracy. In enumerating the
persons engaged in the Rye-house plot, he mentions "Richard
Rumbold, maltster, an old army officer, a desperate and bloody Ravaillac."
After agitating several schemes for assassinating Charles,
the Rye-house was fixed upon as a spot which the king must necessarily
pass in his journey trom Newmarket, and which, being a
solitary moated house, in the actual occupation of Rumbold, afforded
the conspirators facility of previous concealment and subsequent
defence. "All other propositions, as subject to far more
casualties and hazards, soon gave place to that of the Rye, in
Herefordshire, a house then inhabited by the foresaid Richard
Rumbold, who proposed that to be the seat of the action, offering
himself to command the party, that was to do the work. Him,
therefore, as the most daring captain, and by reason of a blemish
in one of his eyes, they were afterwards wont, in common discourse,
to call Hannibal; often drinking healths to <i>Hannibal
and his boys</i>, meaning Rumbold and his <i>hellish crew</i>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Immediately upon the coaches coming within the gates and
hedges about the house, the conspirators were to divide into several
parties; some before, in the habit of labourers, were to overthrow
a cart in the narrowest passage, so as to prevent all possibility
of escape: others were to fight the guards, Walcot chusing
that part upon a punctilio of honour; others were to shoot at the
coachman, postillion, and horses; others to aim only at his Majesty's
coach, which party was to be under the particular direction of
Rumbold himself; the villain declaring beforehand, that, upon that
occasion, he would make use of a very good blunderbuss, which
was in West's possession, and blasphemously adding, that Ferguson
should first consecrate it." ... "But whilst they were thus wholly
intent on this barbarous work, and proceeded securely in its contrivance
without any the least doubt of a prosperous success, behold!
on a sudden, God miraculously disappointed all their hopes
and designs, by the terrible conflagration unexpectedly breaking
out at Newmarket. In which extraordinary event there was one
remarkable passage, that is not so generally taken notice of, as,
for the glory of God, and the confusion of his Majesty's enemies,
it ought to be.</p>

<p>"For, after that the approaching fury of the flames had driven
the king out of his own palace, his Majesty, at first, removed into
another quarter of the town, remote from the fire, and, as yet,
free from any annoyance of smoke and ashes. There his Majesty,
finding he might be tolerably well accommodated, had resolved
to stay, and continue his recreations as before, till the day first
named for his journey back to London. But his Majesty had no
sooner made that resolution, when the wind, as conducted by an
invisible power from above, presently changed about, and blew the
smoke and cinders directly on his new lodging, making them in a
moment as untenable as the other. Upon this, his Majesty being
put to a new shift, and not finding the like conveniency elsewhere,
immediately declared, he would speedily return to Whitehall, as
he did; which happening to be several days before the assassins
expected him, or their preparations for the Rye were in readiness,
it may justly give occasion to all the world to acknowledge, what
one of the very conspirators could not but do, <i>that it was a providential
fire.</i>"&mdash;Pages 51<i> et seq.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The proprietor of the Rye-house (for Rumbold was but a tenant)
shocked at the intended purpose, for which it was to have
been used, is said to have fired it with his own hand. This is the
subject of a poem, called the Loyal Incendiary, or the generous
<i>Boute-feu</i>.</p></li>

<li><a id="Albio_4-10" name="Albio_4-10"></a><p>The total ruin of those, who were directly involved in the Rye-house,
was little to be regretted, had it not involved the fate of those
who were pursuing reform, by means more manly and constitutional,&mdash;the
fate of Russel, Essex, and Sidney.</p>

<p>Rumbold, "the one-eyed archer," fled to Holland, and came to
Scotland with Argyle, on his ill-concerted expedition. He was
singled out and pursued, after the dispersion of his companions in
a skirmish. He defended himself with desperate resolution against
two armed peasants, till a third, coming behind him with a pitch-fork,
turned off his head-piece, when he was cut down and made
prisoner, exclaiming, "Cruel countryman, to use me thus, while
my face was to mine enemy." He suffered the doom of a traitor
at Edinburgh, and maintained on the scaffold, with inflexible firmness,
the principles in which he had lived. He could never believe,
he said, that the many of human kind came into the world
bridled and saddled, and the few with whips and spurs to ride them.
"His rooted ingrained opinion, says Fountainhall, was for a
republic against monarchy, to pull down which he thought a duty,
and no sin." At his death, he declared, that were every hair of
his head a man, he would venture them all in the good old cause.</p></li>

<li><a id="Albio_4-11" name="Albio_4-11"></a><p>"I must not," says Langbaine, "take the pains to acquaint
my reader, that by the man on the pedestal, &amp;c. is meant the late
Lord Shaftesbury. I shall not pretend to pass my censure, whether
he deserved this usage from our author or no, but leave it to
the judgments of statesmen and politicians." Shaftesbury having
been overturned in a carriage, received some internal injury which
required a constant discharge by an issue in his side. Hence he
was ridiculed under the name of <i>Tapski</i>. In a mock account of
an apparition, stated to have appeared to Lady Gray, it says,
"Bid Lord Shaftesbury have a care to his spigot&mdash;if he is tapt, all
the plot will run out." <i>Ralph's History</i>, vol. i. p. 562. from a
pamphlet in Lord Somers' collection. There are various allusions
to this circumstance in the lampoons of the time. A satire called
"The Hypocrite," written by Carryl, concludes thus:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>His body thus and soul together vie.</p>
<p>In vice's empire for the sovereignty;</p>
<p>In ulcers shut this does abound in sin,</p>
<p>Lazar without and Lucifer within.</p>
<p>The silver pipe is no sufficient drain</p>
<p>For the corruption of this little man;</p>
<p>Who, though he ulcers have in every part,</p>
<p>Is no where so corrupt as in his heart.</p>
</div>

<p>At length, in prosecution of this coarse and unhandsome jest, a
sort of vessel with a turn-cock was constructed for holding wine,
which was called a Shaftesbury, and used in the taverns of the
royal party.</p></li>

<h3 class="chap">DON SEBASTIAN.</h3>

<p>The following tragedy is founded upon the adventures supposed
to have befallen Sebastian, king of Portugal, after the fatal
battle of Alcazar. The reader may be briefly reminded of the
memorable expedition of that gallant monarch to Africa, to signalize,
against the Moors, his chivalry as a warrior, and his faith
as a Christian. The ostensible pretext of invasion was the cause
of Muly Mahomet, son of Abdalla, emperor of Morocco; upon
whose death, his brother, Muly Moluch, had seized the crown,
and driven his nephew into exile. The armies joined battle
near Alcazar. The Portuguese, far inferior in number to the
Moors, displayed the most desperate valour, and had nearly won
the day, when Muly Moluch, who, though almost dying, was present
on the field in a litter, fired with shame and indignation,
threw himself on horseback, rallied his troops, renewed the combat,
and, being carried back to his litter, immediately expired,
with his finger placed on his lips, to impress on the chiefs, who
surrounded him, the necessity of concealing his death. The
Moors, rallied by their sovereign's dying exertion, surrounded,
and totally routed, the army of Sebastian. Mahomet, the competitor
for the throne of Morocco, was drowned in passing a river
in his flight, and Sebastian, as his body was never found, probably
perished in the same manner. But where the region of historical
certainty ends, that of romantic tradition commences. The Portuguese,
to whom the memory of their warlike sovereign was deservedly
dear, grasped at the feeble hope which the uncertainty of
his fate afforded, and long, with vain fondness, expected the return
of Sebastian, to free them from the yoke of Spain. This
mysterious termination of a hero's career, as it gave rise to various
political intrigues, (for several persons assumed the name and character
of Sebastian,) early afforded a subject for exercising the fancy
of the dramatist and romance writer. "The Battle of Alcazar<a class="ftnt" href="#Sebas_1-1">[1]</a>"
is known to the collectors of old plays; a ballad on the
<span class="pgnm">274</span><a id="page_274" name="page_274"></a>
same subject is reprinted in Evans's collection; and our author
mentions a French novel on the adventures of Don Sebastian, to
which Langbaine also refers.</p>

<p>The situation of Dryden, after the Revolution, was so delicate
as to require great caution and attention, both in his choice
of a subject, and his mode of treating it. His distressed circumstances
and lessened income compelled him to come before the
public as an author; while the odium attached to the proselyte of
a hated religion, and the partizan of a depressed faction, was likely,
upon the slightest pretext, to transfer itself from the person
of the poet to the labours on which his support depended. He
was, therefore, not only obliged to chuse a theme, which had no
offence in it, and to treat it in a manner which could not admit of
misconstruction, but also so to exert the full force of his talents,
as, by the conspicuous pre-eminence of his genius, to bribe prejudice
and silence calumny. An observing reader will accordingly
discover, throughout the following tragedy, symptoms of minute
finishing, and marks of accurate attention, which, in our author's
better days, he deigned not to bestow upon productions, to which his
name alone was then sufficient to give weight and privilege. His choice
of a subject was singularly happy: the name of Sebastian awaked
historical recollections and associations, favourable to the character
of his hero; while the dark uncertainty of his fate removed all
possibility of shocking the audience by glaring offence against the
majesty of historical truth. The subject has, therefore, all the advantages
of a historical play, without the detects, which either a
rigid coincidence with history, or a violent contradiction of known
truth, seldom fail to bring along with them. Dryden appears
from his preface to have been fully sensible of this; and he has
not lost the advantage of a happy subject by treating it with the
carelessness he sometimes allowed himself to indulge.</p>

<p>The characters in "Don Sebastian" are contrasted with singular
ability and judgment. Sebastian, high-spirited and fiery; the
soul of royal and military honour; the soldier and the king; almost
embodies the idea which the reader forms at the first mention
of his name. Dorax, to whom he is so admirable a contrast,
is one of those characters whom the strong hand of adversity has wrested
from their natural bias; and perhaps no equally vivid picture
can be found, of a subject so awfully interesting. Born with a strong
tendency to all that was honourable and virtuous, the very excess
of his virtues became vice, when his own ill fate, and Sebastian's
injustice, had driven him into exile. By comparing, as Dryden
has requested, the character of Dorax, in the fifth act, with that
he maintains in the former part of the play, the difference may be
traced betwixt his natural virtues, and the vices engrafted on them
by headlong passion and embittering calamity. There is no inconsistence
<span class="pgnm">275</span><a id="page_275" name="page_275"></a>
in the change which takes place after his scene with
Sebastian; as was objected by those, whom the poet justly terms,
"the more ignorant sort of creatures." It is the same picture
in a new light; the same ocean in tempest and in calm; the same
traveller, whom sunshine has induced to abandon his cloak,
which the storm only forced him to wrap more closely around
him. The principal failing of Dorax is the excess of pride, which
renders each supposed wound to his honour more venomously
acute; yet he is not devoid of gentler affections, though even in
indulging these the hardness of his character is conspicuous. He
loves Violante, but that is a far subordinate feeling to his affection
for Sebastian. Indeed, his love appears so inferior to his loyal
devotion to his king, that, unless to gratify the taste of the age, I
see little reason for its being introduced at all. It is obvious he
was much more jealous of the regard of his sovereign, than of
his mistress; he never mentions Violante till the scene of explanation
with Sebastian; and he appears hardly to have retained a
more painful recollection of his disappointment in that particular,
than of the general neglect and disgrace he had sustained at the
court of Lisbon. The last stage of a virtuous heart, corroded into
evil by wounded pride, has been never more forcibly displayed
than in the character of Dorax. When once induced to take the
fatal step which degraded him in his own eyes, all his good affections
seem to be converted into poison. The religion, which displays
itself in the fifth act in his arguments against suicide, had,
in his efforts to justify his apostacy, or at least to render it a matter
of no moment, been exchanged for sentiments approaching,
perhaps to atheism, certainly to total scepticism. His passion
for Violante is changed into contempt and hatred for her sex,
which he expresses in the coarsest terms. His feelings of generosity,
and even of humanity, are drowned in the gloomy and
stern misanthropy, which has its source in the self-discontent
that endeavours to wreak itself upon others. This may be illustrated
by his unfeeling behaviour, while Alvarez and Antonio,
well known to him in former days, approach, and draw the
deadly lot, which ratifies their fate. No yielding of compassion,
no recollection of former friendship, has power to alter the cold
and sardonic sarcasm with which he sketches their characters,
and marks their deportment in that awful moment. Finally, the
zealous attachment of Alonzo for his king, which, in its original
expression, partakes of absolute devotion, is changed, by the circumstances
of Dorax, into an irritated and frantic jealousy, which
he mistakes for hatred; and which, in pursuing the destruction of
its object, is almost more inveterate than hatred itself. Nothing
has survived of the original Alonzo at the opening of the piece,
except the gigantic passion which has caused his ruin. This character
<span class="pgnm">276</span><a id="page_276" name="page_276"></a>
is drawn on a large scale, and in a heroic proportion; but
it is so true to nature, that many readers must have lamented, even
within the circle of domestic acquaintance, instances of feelings
hardened, and virtues perverted, where a high spirit has sustained
severe and unjust neglect and disgrace. The whole demeanour of
this exquisite character suits the original sketch. From "the long
stride and sullen port," by which Benducar distinguishes him at a
distance, to the sullen stubbornness with which he obeys, or the
haughty contempt with which he resists, the commands of the peremptory
tyrant under whom he had taken service, all announce
the untamed pride which had robbed Dorax of virtue, and which
yet, when Benducar would seduce him into a conspiracy, and
in his conduct towards Sebastian, assumes the port and dignity
of virtue herself. In all his conduct and bearing, there is that
mixed feeling and impulse, which constitutes the real spring
of human action. The true motive of Alonzo in saving Sebastian,
is not purely that of honourable hatred, which he proposes to
himself; for to himself every man endeavours to appear consistent,
and readily find arguments to prove to himself that he is so.
Neither is his conduct to be ascribed altogether to the gentler feelings
of loyal and friendly affection, relenting at the sight of his
sovereign's ruin, and impending death. It is the result of a mixture
of these opposite sensations, clashing against each other like
two rivers at their conflux, yet urging their united course down
the same channel. Actuated by a mixture of these feelings, Dorax
meets Sebastian; and the art of the poet is displayed in that
admirable scene, by suggesting a natural motive to justify to the injured
subject himself the change of the course of his feelings. As his
jealousy of Sebastian's favour, and resentment of his unjust neglect,
was chiefly founded on the avowed preference which the king had
given to Henriquez, the opportune mention of his rival's death,
by removing the cause of that jealousy, gives the renegade an
apology to his own pride, for throwing himself at the feet of that
very sovereign, whom a moment before he was determined to
force to combat. They are little acquainted with human passions,
at least have only witnessed their operations among men of
common minds, who doubt, that at the height of their very
spring-tide, they are often most susceptible of sudden changes;
revolutions, which seem to those who have not remarked how
nearly the most opposite feelings are allied and united, the
most extravagant and unaccountable. Muly Moluch is an
admirable specimen of that very frequent theatrical character,&mdash;a
stage tyrant. He is fierce and boisterous enough to be
sufficiently terrible and odious, and that without much rant,
considering he is an infidel Soldan, who, from the ancient deportment
<span class="pgnm">277</span><a id="page_277" name="page_277"></a>
of Mahomed and Termagaunt, as they appeared in the
old Mysteries, might claim a prescriptive right to tear a passion
to tatters. Besides, the Moorish emperor has fine glances of
savage generosity, and that free, unconstrained, and almost
noble openness, the only good quality, perhaps, which a consciousness
of unbounded power may encourage in a mind so firm
as not to be totally depraved by it. The character of Muly
Moluch, like that of Morat, in "Aureng-Zebe," to which it bears a
strong resemblance, was admirably represented by Kynaston; who
had, says Cibber, "a fierce lion-like majesty in his port and utterance,
that gave the spectator a kind of trembling admiration."
It is enough to say of Benducar, that the cool, fawning, intriguing,
and unprincipled statesman, is fully developed in his whole conduct;
and of Alvarez, that the little he has to say and do, is so
said and done, as not to disgrace his common-place character of
the possessor of the secret on which the plot depends; for it may
be casually observed, that the depositary of such a clew to the
catastrophe, though of the last importance to the plot, is seldom
himself of any interest whatever. The haughty and high-spirited
Almeyda is designed by the author as the counterpart of Sebastian.
She breaks out with the same violence, I had almost said
fury, and frequently discovers a sort of kindred sentiment, intended
to prepare the reader for the unfortunate discovery, that she is
the sister of the Portuguese monarch.</p>

<p>Of the diction, Dr Johnson has said, with meagre commendation,
that it has "some sentiments which leave a strong impression,"
and "others of excellence, universally acknowledged." This,
even when the admiration of the scene betwixt Dorax and Sebastian
has been sanctioned by that great critic, seems scanty applause
for the <i>chef d'&oelig;uvre</i> of Dryden's dramatic works. The reader
will be disposed to look for more unqualified praise, when such a
poet was induced, by every pressing consideration, to combine, in
one effort, the powers of his mighty genius, and the fruits of his
long theatrical experience: Accordingly, Shakespeare laid aside,
it will be perhaps difficult to point out a play containing more
animatory incident, impassioned language, and beautiful description,
than "Don Sebastian." Of the former, the scene betwixt
Dorax and the king, had it been the only one ever Dryden wrote,
would have been sufficient to insure his immortality. There is
not,&mdash;no, perhaps, not even in Shakespeare,&mdash;an instance where the
chord, which the poet designed should vibrate, is more happily
struck; strains there are of a higher mood, but not more correctly
true; in evidence of which, we have known those, whom distresses
of a gentler nature were unable to move, feel their stubborn
feelings roused and melted by the injured pride and deep repentance
of Dorax. The burst of anguish with which he answers
<span class="pgnm">278</span><a id="page_278" name="page_278"></a>
the stern taunt of Sebastian, is one of those rare, but natural instances,
in which high-toned passion assumes a figurative language,
because all that is familiar seems inadequate to express its
feelings:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Dor.</span> Thou hast dared<br />
To tell me, what I durst not tell myself:<br />
I durst not think that I was spurned, and live;<br />
And live to hear it boasted to my face.<br />
All my long avarice of honour lost,<br />
Heaped up in youth, and hoarded up for age!<br />
Has honour's fountain then sucked back the stream?<br />
He has; and hooting boys may dry-shod pass,<br />
And gather pebbles from the naked ford.<br />
Give me my love, my honour; give them back&mdash;<br />
Give me revenge, while I have breath to ask it!</p>
</div>

<p>But I will not dwell on the beauties of this scene. If any one
is incapable of relishing it, he may safely conclude, that nature
has not merely denied him that rare gift, poetical taste, but
common powers of comprehending the ordinary feelings of humanity.
The love scene, betwixt Sebastian and Almeyda, is more
purely conceived, and expressed with more reference to sentiment,
than is common with our author. The description which Dorax
gives of Sebastian, before his appearance, coming from a mortal
enemy, at least from one whose altered love was as envenomed
as hatred, is a grand preparation for the appearance of the
hero. In many of the slighter descriptive passages, we recognize
the poet by those minute touches, which a mind susceptible of
poetic feeling is alone capable of bringing out. The approach of the
emperor, while the conspirators are caballing, is announced by
Orchan, with these picturesque circumstances:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>I see the blaze of torches from afar,</p>
<p>And hear the trampling of thick-beating feet&mdash;</p>
<p>This way they move.&mdash;</p>
</div>

<p>The following account, given by the slave sent to observe what
passed in the castle of Dorax, believed to be dead, or dying, is
equally striking:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Haly.</span> Two hours I warily have watched his palace:<br />
All doors are shut, no servant peeps abroad;<br />
Some officers, with striding haste, past in;<br />
While others outward went on quick dispatch.<br />
Sometimes hushed silence seemed to reign within;<br />
Then cries confused, and a joint clamour followed;<br />
Then lights went gliding by, from room to room,<br />
And shot like thwarting meteors cross the house.<br />
Not daring further to inquire, I came<br />
With speed to bring you this imperfect news.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pgnm">279</span><a id="page_279" name="page_279"></a>
The description of the midnight insurrection of the rabble is
not less impressive:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ham.</span> What you wish:<br />
The streets are thicker in this noon of night,<br />
Than at the mid-day sun: A drouzy horror<br />
Sits on their eyes, like fear, not well awake:<br />
All crowd in heaps, as, at a night alarm,<br />
The bees drive out upon each others backs,<br />
T'imboss their hives in clusters; all ask news:<br />
Their busy captain runs the weary round<br />
To whisper orders; and, commanding silence,<br />
Makes not noise cease, but deafens it to murmurs.</p>
</div>

<p>These illustrations are designedly selected from the parts of the
lower characters, because they at once evince the diligence and
success with which Dryden has laboured even the subordinate
points of this tragedy.</p>

<p>"Don Sebastian" has been weighed, with reference to its tragic
merits, against "Love for Love;" and one or other is universally
allowed to be the first of Dryden's dramatic performances. To the
youth of both sexes the latter presents the most pleasing subject
of emotion; but to those whom age has rendered incredulous upon
the romantic effects of love, and who do not fear to look into the
recesses of the human heart, when agitated by darker and more
stubborn passions, "Don Sebastian" offers a far superior source of
gratification.</p>

<p>To point out the blemishes of so beautiful a tragedy, is a painful,
though a necessary, task. The style, here and there, exhibits
marks of a reviving taste for those frantic bursts of passion, which
our author has himself termed the "Dalilahs of the theatre."
The first speech of Sebastian has been often noticed as an extravagant
rant, more worthy of Maximin, or Almanzor, than of a character
drawn by our author in his advanced years, and chastened
taste:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>I beg no pity for this mouldering clay;</p>
<p>For if you give it burial, there it takes</p>
<p>Possession of your earth:</p>
<p>If burnt and scatter'd in the air, the winds,</p>
<p>That strew my dust, diffuse my royalty,</p>
<p>And spread me o'er your clime; for where one atom</p>
<p>Of mine shall light, know, there Sebastian reigns.</p>
</div>

<p>The reader's discernment will discover some similar extravagancies
in the language of Almeyda and the Emperor.</p>

<p>It is a separate objection, that the manners of the age and country
are not adhered to. Sebastian, by disposition a crusading
knight-errant, devoted to religion and chivalry, becomes, in the
hands of Dryden, merely a gallant soldier and high-spirited prince,
such as existed in the poet's own days. But, what is worse, the
<span class="pgnm">280</span><a id="page_280" name="page_280"></a>
manners of Mahometans are shockingly violated. Who ever heard
of human sacrifices, or of any sacrifices, being offered up to Mahomet<a class="ftnt" href="#Sebas_1-2">[2]</a>;
and when were his followers able to use the classical and
learned allusions which occur throughout the dialogue! On this
last topic Addison makes the following observations, in the
"Guardian," No. 110.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I have now Mr Dryden's "Don Sebastian" before me, in
which I find frequent allusions to ancient poetry, and the old mythology
of the heathens. It is not very natural to suppose a king
of Portugal would be borrowing thoughts out of Ovid's "Metamorphoses,"
when he talked even to those of his own court; but
to allude to these Roman fables, when he talks to an emperor of
Barbary, seems very extraordinary. But observe how he defies
him out of the classics in the following lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Why didst not thou engage me man to man,</p>
<p>And try the virtue of that Gorgon face,</p>
<p>To stare me into statue?</p>
</div>

<p>"Almeyda, at the same time, is more book-learned than Don
Sebastian. She plays an Hydra upon the Emperor, that is full as
good as the Gorgon:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>O that I had the fruitful heads of Hydra,</p>
<p>That one might bourgeon where another fell!</p>
<p>Still would I give thee work, still, still, thou tyrant,</p>
<p>And hiss thee with the last.</p>
</div>

<p>"She afterwards, in allusion to Hercules, bids him 'lay down
the lion's skin, and take the distaff;' and, in the following speech,
utters her passion still more learnedly:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>No; were we joined, even though it were in death,</p>
<p>Our bodies burning in one funeral pile,</p>
<p>The prodigy of Thebes would be renewed,</p>
<p>And my divided flame should break from thine.</p>
</div>

<p>"The emperor of Barbary shews himself acquainted with the
Roman poets as well as either of his prisoners, and answers the
foregoing speech in the same classic strain:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>Serpent, I will engender poison with thee:</p>
<p>Our offspring, like the seed of dragon's teeth,</p>
<p>Shall issue armed, and fight themselves to death.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pgnm">281</span><a id="page_281" name="page_281"></a>
"Ovid seems to have been Muley-Moloch's favourite author;
witness the lines that follow:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>She, still inexorable, still imperious,</p>
<p>And loud, as if, like Bacchus, born in thunder.</p>
</div>

<p>"I shall conclude my remarks on his part with that poetical
complaint of his being in love; and leave my reader to consider,
how prettily it would sound in the mouth of an emperor of Morocco:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>The god of love once more has shot his fires</p>
<p>Into my soul, and my whole heart receives him.</p>
</div>

<p>"Muley Zeydan is as ingenious a man as his brother Muley
Moloch; as where he hints at the story of Castor and Pollux:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>May we ne'er meet;</p>
<p>For, like the twins of Leda, when I mount,</p>
<p>He gallops down the skies.</p>
</div>

<p>"As for the Mufti, we will suppose that he was bred up a
scholar, and not only versed in the law of Mahomet, but acquainted
with all kinds of polite learning. For this reason he is
not at all surprised when Dorax calls him a Ph&aelig;ton in one place,
and in another tells him he is like Archimedes.</p>

<p>"The Mufti afterwards mentions Ximenes, Albornoz, and cardinal
Wolsey, by name. The poet seems to think, he may make
every person, in his play, know as much as himself, and talk as
well as he could have done on the same occasion. At least, I believe,
every reader will agree with me, that the above-mentioned
sentiments, to which I might have added several others, would
have been better suited to the court of Augustus than that of Muley
Moloch. I grant they are beautiful in themselves, and much
more so in that noble language, which was peculiar to this great
poet. I only observe, that they are improper for the persons who
make use of them."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The catastrophe of the tragedy may be also censured, not only
on the grounds objected to that of "&OElig;dipus," but because it does
not naturally flow from the preceding events, and opens, in the
fifth act, a new set of persons, and a train of circumstances, unconnected
with the preceding action. In the concluding scene, it
was remarked, by the critics, that there is a want of pure taste
in the lovers dwelling more upon the pleasures than the horrors
of their incestuous connection.</p>

<p>Of the lighter scenes, which were intended for comic, Dr Johnson
has said, "they are such as that age did not probably commend,
and as the present would not endure." Dryden has remarked,
with self-complacency, the art with which they are made to
<span class="pgnm">282</span><a id="page_282" name="page_282"></a>
depend upon the serious business. This has not, however, the merit
of novelty; being not unlike the connection between the tragic
and comic scenes of the "Spanish Friar." The persons introduced
have also some resemblance; though the gaiety of Antonio
is far more gross than that of Lorenzo, and Morayma is a very
poor copy of Elvira. It is rather surprising, that when a gay libertine
was to be introduced, Dryden did not avail himself of a real
character, the English Stukely; a wild gallant, who, after spending a
noble fortune, became the leader of a band of Italian Condottieri,
engaged in the service of Sebastian, and actually fell in the battle
of Alcazar. Collier complains, and with very good reason, that,
in the character of the Mufti, Dryden has seized an opportunity
to deride and calumniate the priesthood of every religion; an opportunity
which, I am sorry to say, he seldom fails to use with
unjustifiable inveteracy. The rabble scenes were probably given,
as our author himself says of that in Cleomenes, "to gratify the
more barbarous part of the audience." Indeed, to judge from the
practice of the drama at this time, the representation of a riot
upon the stage seems to have had the same charms for the popular
part of the English audience, which its reality always possesses
in the streets.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the excellence of this tragedy, it appears to
have been endured, rather than applauded, at its first representation;
although, being judiciously curtailed, it soon became a
great favourite with the public<a class="ftnt" href="#Sebas_1-3">[3]</a>; and, omitting the comic scenes,
may be again brought forward with advantage, when the public
shall be tired of children and of show. The tragedy of "Don
Sebastian" was acted and printed in 1690.</p>

EARL OF LEICESTER, &amp;c.<a class="ftnt" href="#Sebas_2-1">[1]</a></h3>

<p>Far be it from me, my most noble lord, to think,
that any thing which my meanness can produce,
should be worthy to be offered to your patronage;
or that aught which I can say of you should recommend
you farther to the esteem of good men
in this present age, or to the veneration which will
<span class="pgnm">284</span><a id="page_284" name="page_284"></a>
certainly be paid you by posterity. On the other
side, I must acknowledge it a great presumption in
me, to make you this address; and so much the
greater, because by the common suffrage even of
contrary parties, you have been always regarded as
one of the first persons of the age, and yet not one
writer has dared to tell you so; whether we have
been all conscious to ourselves that it was a needless
labour to give this notice to mankind, as all
men are ashamed to tell stale news; or that we
were justly diffident of our own performances, as
even Cicero is observed to be in awe when he writes
to Atticus; where, knowing himself over-matched in
good sense, and truth of knowledge, he drops the
gaudy train of words, and is no longer the vain-glorious
orator. From whatever reason it may be,
I am the first bold offender of this kind: I have
broken down the fence, and ventured into the holy
grove. How I may be punished for my profane
attempt, I know not; but I wish it may not be of
ill omen to your lordship: and that a crowd of bad
writers do not rush into the quiet of your recesses
after me. Every man in all changes of government,
which have been, or may possibly arrive, will
agree, that I could not have offered my incense,
where it could be so well deserved. For you, my
lord, are secure in your own merit; and all parties,
as they rise uppermost, are sure to court you in
<span class="pgnm">285</span><a id="page_285" name="page_285"></a>
their turns; it is a tribute which has ever been paid
your virtue. The leading men still bring their
bullion to your mint, to receive the stamp of their
intrinsic value, that they may afterwards hope to
pass with human kind. They rise and fall in the
variety of revolutions, and are sometimes great, and
therefore wise in men's opinions, who must court
them for their interest. But the reputation of their
parts most commonly follows their success; few of
them are wise, but as they are in power; because
indeed, they have no sphere of their own, but, like
the moon in the Copernican system of the world,
are whirled about by the motion of a greater planet.
This it is to be ever busy; neither to give rest to
their fellow-creatures, nor, which is more wretchedly
ridiculous, to themselves; though, truly, the
latter is a kind of justice, and giving mankind a
due revenge, that they will not permit their own
hearts to be at quiet, who disturb the repose of all
beside them. Ambitious meteors! how willing they
are to set themselves upon the wing, and taking
every occasion of drawing upward to the sun, not
considering that they have no more time allowed
them for their mounting, than the short revolution
of a day; and that when the light goes from them,
they are of necessity to fall. How much happier
is he, (and who he is I need not say, for there is
but one ph&oelig;nix in an age) who, centering on himself,
remains immoveable, and smiles at the madness
of the dance about him? he possesses the midst,
which is the portion of safety and content. He
will not be higher, because he needs it not; but by
the prudence of that choice, he puts it out of fortune's
power to throw him down. It is confest,
that if he had not so been born, he might have
been too high for happiness; but not endeavouring
to ascend, he secures the native height of his station
<span class="pgnm">286</span><a id="page_286" name="page_286"></a>
from envy, and cannot descend from what he
is, because he depends not on another. What a
glorious character was this once in Rome! I should
say, in Athens; when, in the disturbances of a state
as mad as ours, the wise Pomponius transported all
the remaining wisdom and virtue of his country
into the sanctuary of peace and learning. But I
would ask the world, (for you, my lord, are too
nearly concerned to judge this cause) whether there
may not yet be found a character of a noble Englishman,
equally shining with that illustrious Roman?
Whether I need to name a second Atticus?
or whether the world has not already prevented me,
and fixed it there, without my naming? Not a second,
with a <i>longo sed proximus intervallo</i>; not a
young Marcellus, flattered by a poet into the resemblance
of the first, with a <i>frons l&aelig;ta parum, et
dejecto lumina vultu</i>, and the rest that follows, <i>si
qua fata aspera rumpas, tu Marcellus eris</i>; but a
person of the same stamp and magnitude, who owes
nothing to the former, besides the word Roman,
and the superstition of reverence, devolving on him
by the precedency of eighteen hundred years; one
who walks by him with equal paces, and shares the
eyes of beholders with him; one who had been
first, had he first lived; and, in spite of doating veneration,
is still his equal: both of them born of
noble families, in unhappy ages of change and tumult;
both of them retiring from affairs of state;
yet not leaving the commonwealth, till it had left
itself; but never returning to public business, when
they had once quitted it, though courted by the
heads of either party. But who would trust the
quiet of their lives with the extravagancies of their
countrymen, when they are just in the giddiness
of their turning; when the ground was tottering
under them at every moment; and none could guess
<span class="pgnm">287</span><a id="page_287" name="page_287"></a>
whether the next heave of the earthquake would
settle them on the first foundation, or swallow it?
Both of them knew mankind exactly well, for both
of them began that study in themselves, and there
they found the best part of human composition; the
worst they learned by long experience of the folly,
ignorance, and immorality of most beside them.
Their philosophy, on both sides, was not wholly
speculative, for that is barren, and produces nothing
but vain ideas of things which cannot possibly be
known, or, if they could, yet would only terminate
in the understanding; but it was a noble, vigorous
and practical philosophy, which exerted itself in all
the offices of pity, to those who were unfortunate,
and deserved not so to be. The friend was always
more considered by them than the cause; and an
Octavius, or an Antony in distress, were relieved by
them, as well as a Brutus or a Cassius; for the
lowermost party, to a noble mind, is ever the fittest
object of good-will. The eldest of them, I will
suppose, for his honour, to have been of the academic
sect, neither dogmatist nor stoick; if he were
not, I am sure he ought, in common justice, to
yield the precedency to his younger brother. For
stiffness of opinion is the effect of pride, and not of
philosophy; it is a miserable presumption of that
knowledge which human nature is too narrow to
contain; and the ruggedness of a stoick is only a
silly affectation of being a god,&mdash;to wind himself
up by pullies to an insensibility of suffering, and,
at the same time, to give the lie to his own experience,
by saying he suffers not, what he knows he
feels. True philosophy is certainly of a more pliant
nature, and more accommodated to human use; <i>Homo
sum, humani &agrave; me nihil alienum puto.</i> A wise
man will never attempt an impossibility; and such
it is to strain himself beyond the nature of his being,
<span class="pgnm">288</span><a id="page_288" name="page_288"></a>
either to become a deity, by being above suffering,
or to debase himself into a stock or stone,
by pretending not to feel it. To find in ourselves
the weaknesses and imperfections of our wretched
kind, is surely the most reasonable step we can
make towards the compassion of our fellow-creatures.
I could give examples of this kind in the
second Atticus. In every turn of state, without
meddling on either side, he has always been favourable
and assisting to opprest merit. The praises
which were given by a great poet to the late queen-mother,
on her rebuilding Somerset Palace, one part
of which was fronting to the mean houses on the
other side of the water, are as justly his:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>For the distrest and the afflicted lie</p>
<p>Most in his thoughts, and always in his eye<a class="ftnt" href="#Sebas_2-2">[2]</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Neither has he so far forgotten a poor inhabitant of
his suburbs, whose best prospect is on the garden of
Leicester House, but that more than once he has
been offering him his patronage, to reconcile him to
<span class="pgnm">289</span><a id="page_289" name="page_289"></a>
a world, of which his misfortunes have made him
weary<a class="ftnt" href="#Sebas_2-3">[3]</a>. There is another Sidney still remaining,
though there can never be another Spenser to deserve
the favour. But one Sidney gave his patronage
to the applications of a poet; the other offered
it unasked. Thus, whether as a second Atticus, or
a second Sir Philip Sidney, the latter in all respects
will not have the worse of the comparison; and if
he will take up with the second place, the world will
not so far flatter his modesty, as to seat him there,
unless it be out of a deference of manners, that he
may place himself where he pleases at his own
table.</p>

<p>I may therefore safely conclude, that he, who, by
the consent of all men, bears so eminent a character,
will out of his inborn nobleness forgive the
presumption of this address. It is an unfinished picture,
I confess, but the lines and features are so like,
that it cannot be mistaken for any other; and
without writing any name under it, every beholder
must cry out, at first sight,&mdash;this was designed for
Atticus; but the bad artist has cast too much of
him into shades. But I have this excuse, that even
the greatest masters commonly fall short of the best
faces. They may flatter an indifferent beauty; but
the excellencies of nature can have no right done
to them; for there both the pencil and pen are
overcome by the dignity of the subject; as our admirable
Waller has expressed it,</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>The heroe's race transcends the poet's thought.</p>
</div>

<p>There are few in any age who can bear the load
<span class="pgnm">290</span><a id="page_290" name="page_290"></a>
of a dedication; for where praise is undeserved, it is
satire; though satire on folly is now no longer a
scandal to any one person, where a whole age is
dipt together. Yet I had rather undertake a multitude
one way, than a single Atticus the other; for
it is easier to descend than it is to climb. I should
have gone ashamed out of the world, if I had not
at least attempted this address, which I have long
thought owing: and if I had never attempted, I
might have been vain enough to think I might
have succeeded in it. Now I have made the experiment,
and have failed through my unworthiness,
I may rest satisfied, that either the adventure is not
to be atchieved, or that it is reserved for some other
hand.</p>

<p>Be pleased, therefore, since the family of the Attici
is and ought to be above the common forms of
concluding letters, that I may take my leave in the
words of Cicero to the first of them: <i>Me, O Pomponi,
vald&egrave; p&aelig;nitet vivere: tant&ugrave;m te oro, ut quoniam
me ipse semper am&agrave;sti, ut eodem amore sis; ego nimirum
idem sum. Inimici mei mea mihi non meipsum
ademerunt. Cura, Attice, ut valeas.</i></p>

the Revolution was attached to Dryden's politics and religion, he
seems occasionally to have sought for patrons amongst those Nobles
of opposite principles, whom moderation, or love of literature,
rendered superior to the suggestions of party rancour; or, as
he himself has expressed it in the Dedication of "Amphitryon,"
who, though of a contrary opinion themselves, blamed him not for
adhering to a lost cause, and judging for himself what he could not
chuse but judge. Philip Sidney, the third earl of Leicester, had taken
an active part against the king in the civil wars, had been named one
of his judges, though he never look his seat among the regicides,
and had been one of Cromwell's Council of State. He was brother
of the famous Algernon Sidney, and although retired from party
strife, during the violent contests betwixt the Whigs and Tories in
1682-3, there can be no doubt which way his inclinations leaned.
He died 6th March, 1696-7, aged more than eighty years.
Mr Malone has strongly censured the strain of this Dedication,
because it represents Leicester as abstracted from parties and public
affairs, notwithstanding his active share in the civil wars. Yet
Dryden was not obliged to draw the portrait of his patron from
his conduct thirty years before; and if Leicester's character was
to be taken from the latter part of his life, surely the praise of
moderation is due to him, who, during the factious contests of
Charles II's. reign, in which his own brother made so conspicuous

<h3 class="chap">THE
PREFACE.</h3>

<p>Whether it happened through a long disuse of
writing, that I forgot the usual compass of a play,
or that, by crowding it with characters and incidents,
I put a necessity upon myself of lengthening
the main action, I know not; but the first day's
audience sufficiently convinced me of my error, and
that the poem was insupportably too long. It is
an ill ambition of us poets, to please an audience
with more than they can bear; and supposing that
we wrote as well as vainly we imagine ourselves to
write, yet we ought to consider, that no man can
bear to be long tickled. There is a nauseousness in
a city-feast, when we are to sit four hours after we
are cloyed. I am therefore, in the first place, to
acknowledge, with all manner of gratitude, their
civility, who were pleased to endure it with so
much patience; to be weary with so much good-nature
and silence; and not to explode an entertainment
which was designed to please them, or
discourage an author, whose misfortunes have once
<span class="pgnm">292</span><a id="page_292" name="page_292"></a>
more brought him, against his will, upon the stage.
While I continue in these bad circumstances, (and,
truly, I see very little probability of coming out)
I must be obliged to write; and if I may still hope
for the same kind usage, I shall the less repent of
that hard necessity. I write not this out of any
expectation to be pitied, for I have enemies enow
to wish me yet in a worse condition; but give me
leave to say, that if I can please by writing, as I shall
endeavour it, the town may be somewhat obliged
to my misfortunes for a part of their diversion.
Having been longer acquainted with the stage than
any poet now living, and having observed how difficult
it was to please; that the humours of comedy
were almost spent; that love and honour (the
mistaken topics of tragedy) were quite worn out;
that the theatres could not support their charges;
that the audience forsook them; that young men,
without learning, set up for judges, and that they
talked loudest, who understood the least; all these
discouragements had not only weaned me from the
stage, but had also given me a loathing of it. But
enough of this: the difficulties continue; they increase;
and I am still condemned to dig in those
exhausted mines.</p>

<p>Whatever fault I next commit, rest assured it
shall not be that of too much length: Above twelve
hundred lines have been cut off from this tragedy
since it was first delivered to the actors. They
were indeed so judiciously lopped by Mr Betterton,
to whose care and excellent action I am equally obliged,
that the connection of the story was not lost;
but, on the other side, it was impossible to prevent
some part of the action from being precipitated, and
coming on without that due preparation which is
required to all great events: as, in particular, that
of raising the mobile, in the beginning of the fourth
act, which a man of Benducar's cool character
<span class="pgnm">293</span><a id="page_293" name="page_293"></a>
could not naturally attempt, without taking all
those precautions, which he foresaw would be necessary
to render his design successful. On this
consideration, I have replaced those lines through
the whole poem, and thereby restored it to that
clearness of conception, and (if I may dare to say it)
that lustre and masculine vigour, in which it was
first written. It is obvious to every understanding
reader, that the most poetical parts, which are descriptions,
images, similitudes, and moral sentences,
are those which of necessity were to be pared away,
when the body was swollen into too large a bulk
for the representation of the stage. But there is a
vast difference betwixt a public entertainment on
the theatre, and a private reading in the closet: In
the first, we are confined to time; and though we
talk not by the hour-glass, yet the watch often
drawn out of the pocket warns the actors that their
audience is weary; in the last, every reader is judge
of his own convenience; he can take up the book
and lay it down at his pleasure, and find out those
beauties of propriety in thought and writing, which
escaped him in the tumult and hurry of representing.
And I dare boldly promise for this play, that
in the roughness of the numbers and cadences,
(which I assure was not casual, but so designed)
you will see somewhat more masterly arising to
your view, than in most, if not any, of my former
tragedies. There is a more noble daring in the
figures, and more suitable to the loftiness of the
subject; and, besides this, some newnesses of English,
translated from the beauties of modern tongues,
as well as from the elegancies of the Latin; and
here and there some old words are sprinkled, which,
for their significance and sound, deserved not to be
antiquated; such as we often find in Sallust amongst
the Roman authors, and in Milton's "Paradise"
<span class="pgnm">294</span><a id="page_294" name="page_294"></a>
amongst ours; though perhaps the latter, instead
of sprinkling, has dealt them with too free a hand,
even sometimes to the obscuring of his sense.</p>

<p>As for the story, or plot, of the tragedy, it is
purely fiction; for I take it up where the history
has laid it down. We are assured by all writers of
those times, that Sebastian, a young prince of great
courage and expectation, undertook that war, partly
upon a religious account, partly at the solicitation
of Muley Mahomet, who had been driven out
of his dominions by Abdelmelech, or, as others call
him, Muley Moluch, his nigh kinsman, who descended
from the same family of Xeriffs, whose fathers,
Hamet and Mahomet, had conquered that
empire with joint forces, and shared it betwixt them
after their victory; that the body of Don Sebastian
was never found in the field of battle, which gave
occasion for many to believe, that he was not slain<a class="ftnt" href="#Sebas_3-1">[1]</a>;
<span class="pgnm">295</span><a id="page_295" name="page_295"></a>
that some years after, when the Spaniards, with a
pretended title, by force of arms, had usurped the
crown of Portugal from the house of Braganza, a
certain person, who called himself Don Sebastian,
and had all the marks of his body and features of
his face, appeared at Venice, where he was owned
by some of his countrymen; but being seized by
the Spaniards, was first imprisoned, then sent to the
gallies, and at last put to death in private. It is
most certain, that the Portuguese expected his return
for almost an age together after that battle,
which is at least a proof of their extreme love to
his memory; and the usage they had from their
new conquerors, might possibly make them so extravagant
in their hopes and wishes for their old
master<a class="ftnt" href="#Sebas_3-2">[2]</a>.</p>

<p>This ground-work the history afforded me, and I
desire no better to build a play upon; for where
the event of a great action is left doubtful, there
the poet is left master. He may raise what he pleases
on that foundation, provided he makes it of a
<span class="pgnm">296</span><a id="page_296" name="page_296"></a>
piece, and according to the rule of probability.
From hence I was only obliged, that Sebastian
should return to Portugal no more; but at the
same time I had him at my own disposal, whether
to bestow him in Afric, or in any other corner of
the world, or to have closed the tragedy with his
death; and the last of these was certainly the most
easy, but for the same reason the least artful; because,
as I have somewhere said, the poison and the
dagger are still at hand to butcher a hero, when a
poet wants the brains to save him. It being therefore
only necessary, according to the laws of the
drama, that Sebastian should no more be seen upon
the throne, I leave it for the world to judge, whether
or no I have disposed of him according to art,
or have bungled up the conclusion of his adventure.
In the drawing of his character, I forgot not piety,
which any one may observe to be one principal ingredient
of it, even so far as to be a habit in him;
though I shew him once to be transported from it
by the violence of a sudden passion, to endeavour a
self-murder. This being presupposed, that he was
religious, the horror of his incest, though innocently
committed, was the best reason which the stage
could give for hindering his return. It is true, I
have no right to blast his memory with such a
crime; but declaring it to be fiction, I desire my
audience to think it no longer true, than while they
are seeing it represented; for that once ended, he
may be a saint, for aught I know, and we have reason
to presume he is. On this supposition, it was
unreasonable to have killed him; for the learned
Mr Rymer has well observed, that in all punishments
we are to regulate ourselves by poetical justice;
and according to those measures, an involuntary
sin deserves not death; from whence it follows,
<span class="pgnm">297</span><a id="page_297" name="page_297"></a>
that to divorce himself from the beloved object,
to retire into a desert, and deprive himself of
a throne, was the utmost punishment which a poet
could inflict, as it was also the utmost reparation
which Sebastian could make. For what relates to
Almeyda, her part is wholly fictitious. I know it is
the surname of a noble family in Portugal, which
was very instrumental in the restoration of Don
John de Braganza, father to the most illustrious and
most pious princess, our queen-dowager. The French
author of a novel, called "Don Sebastian," has given
that name to an African lady of his own invention,
and makes her sister to Muley Mahomet; but I
have wholly changed the accidents, and borrowed
nothing but the supposition, that she was beloved
by the king of Portugal. Though, if I had taken
the whole story, and wrought it up into a play, I
might have done it exactly according to the practice
of almost all the ancients, who were never accused
of being plagiaries for building their tragedies
on known fables. Thus, Augustus C&aelig;sar wrote an
"Ajax," which was not the less his own, because
Euripides had written a play before him on that
subject. Thus, of late years, Corneille writ an "&OElig;dipus"
after Sophocles; and I have designed one after
him, which I wrote with Mr Lee; yet neither
the French poet stole from the Greek, nor we from
the Frenchman. It is the contrivance, the new
turn, and new characters, which alter the property,
and make it ours. The <i>materia poetica</i> is as common
to all writers, as the <i>materia medica</i> to all physicians.
Thus, in our Chronicles, Daniel's history is
still his own, though Matthew Paris, Stow, and
Hollingshed writ before him; otherwise we must
have been content with their dull relations, if a
better pen had not been allowed to come after them,
<span class="pgnm">298</span><a id="page_298" name="page_298"></a>
and writ his own account after a new and better
manner.</p>

<p>I must further declare freely, that I have not exactly
kept to the three mechanic rules of unity. I
knew them, and had them in my eye, but followed
them only at a distance; for the genius of the English
cannot bear too regular a play: we are given to
variety, even to a debauchery of pleasure. My
scenes are therefore sometimes broken, because my
underplot required them so to be, though the general
scene remains,&mdash;of the same castle; and I have
taken the time of two days, because the variety of
accidents, which are here represented, could not naturally
be supposed to arrive in one: but to gain a
greater beauty, it is lawful for a poet to supersede a
less.</p>

<p>I must likewise own, that I have somewhat deviated
from the known history, in the death of
Muley Moluch, who, by all relations, died of a fever
in the battle, before his army had wholly won
the field; but if I have allowed him another day
of life, it was because I stood in need of so shining
a character of brutality as I have given him; which
is indeed the same with that of the present emperor
Muley-Ishmael, as some of our English officers,
who have been in his court, have credibly informed
me.</p>

<p>I have been listening&mdash;what objections had been
made against the conduct of the play; but found
them all so trivial, that if I should name them, a
true critic would imagine that I played booty, and
only raised up phantoms for myself to conquer.
Some are pleased to say&mdash;the writing is dull; but,
<i>&aelig;tatem habet, de se loquatur.</i> Others, that the double
poison is unnatural: let the common received opinion,
and Ausonius his famous epigram, answer
<span class="pgnm">299</span><a id="page_299" name="page_299"></a>
that<a class="ftnt" href="#Sebas_3-3">[3]</a>. Lastly, a more ignorant sort of creatures
than either of the former maintain, that the character
of Dorax is not only unnatural, but inconsistent
with itself: let them read the play, and
think again; and if yet they are not satisfied, cast
their eyes on that chapter of the wise Montaigne,
which is intitled, <i>De l'Inconstance des Actions humaines</i>.
A longer reply is what those cavillers deserve
not; but I will give them and their fellows
to understand, that the earl of Dorset was pleased
to read the tragedy twice over before it was acted,
and did me the favour to send me word, that I had
written beyond any of my former plays, and that he
was displeased any thing should be cut away. If I
have not reason to prefer his single judgment to a
whole faction, let the world be judge; for the opposition
is the same with that of Lucan's hero
against an army; <i>concurrere bellum, atque virum</i>.</p>

<p>I think I may modestly conclude, that whatever
errors there may be, either in the design, or writing
of this play, they are not those which have been
objected to it. I think also, that I am not yet arrived
to the age of doting; and that I have given
so much application to this poem, that I could not
probably let it run into many gross absurdities;
<span class="pgnm">300</span><a id="page_300" name="page_300"></a>
which may caution my enemies from too rash a
censure, and may also encourage my friends, who
are many more than I could reasonably have expected,
to believe their kindness has not been very
undeservedly bestowed on me. This is not a play
that was huddled up in haste; and, to shew it was
not, I will own, that, besides the general moral of
it, which is given in the four last lines, there is also
another moral, couched under every one of the
principal parts and characters, which a judicious
critic will observe, though I point not to it in this
preface. And there may be also some secret beauties
in the decorum of parts, and uniformity of design,
which my puny judges will not easily find out:
let them consider in the last scene of the fourth
act, whether I have not preserved the rule of decency,
in giving all the advantage to the royal character,
and in making Dorax first submit. Perhaps
too they may have thought, that it was through indigence
of characters that I have given the same to Sebastian
and Almeyda, and consequently made them
alike in all things but their sex. But let them look
a little deeper into the matter, and they will find,
that this identity of character in the greatness of
their souls was intended for a preparation of the
final discovery, and that the likeness of their nature
was a fair hint to the proximity of their blood.</p>

<p>To avoid the imputation of too much vanity, (for
all writers, and especially poets, will have some,) I
will give but one other instance, in relation to the
uniformity of the design. I have observed, that
the English will not bear a thorough tragedy; but
are pleased, that it should be lightened with underparts
of mirth. It had been easy for me to have
given my audience a better course of comedy, I
mean a more diverting, than that of Antonio and
Morayma; but I dare appeal, even to my enemies,
<span class="pgnm">301</span><a id="page_301" name="page_301"></a>
if I, or any man, could have invented one, which
had been more of a piece, and more depending on
the serious part of the design. For what could be
more uniform, than to draw from out of the members
of a captive court, the subject of a comical entertainment?
To prepare this episode, you see Dorax
giving the character of Antonio, in the beginning
of the play, upon his first sight of him at the
lottery; and to make the dependence, Antonio is
engaged, in the fourth act, for the deliverance of
Almeyda; which is also prepared, by his being first
made a slave to the captain of the rabble.</p>

<p>I should beg pardon for these instances; but perhaps
they may be of use to future poets, in the conduct
of their plays; at least, if I appear too positive,
I am growing old, and thereby in possession
of some experience, which men in years will always
assume for a right of talking. Certainly if a man
can ever have reason to set a value on himself, it is
when his ungenerous enemies are taking the advantage
of the times upon him, to ruin him in his reputation.
And therefore, for once, I will make
bold to take the counsel of my old master Virgil,</p>

<li><a id="Sebas_4-1" name="Sebas_4-1"></a><p>The humour of this intended prologue turns upon the unwillingness displayed
to attend King William into Ireland by many of the nobility and
gentry, who had taken arms at the Revolution. The truth is, that, though invited
to go as volunteers, they could not but consider themselves as hostages,
of whom William did not chuse to lose sight, lest, while he was conquering
Ireland, he might, perchance, lose England, by means of the very men by
whom he had won it. The disbanding of the royal regiment had furnished a subject
for the satirical wit of Buckingham, at least, such a piece is printed in his
Miscellanies; and for that of Shadwell, in his epilogue to Bury-fair. But Shadwell
was now poet-laureat, and his satire was privileged, like the wit of the ancient
royal jester. Our author was suspected of disaffection, and liable to
misconstruction: For which reason, probably, he declined this sarcastic prologue,
and substituted that which follows, the tone of which is submissive,
and conciliatory towards the government. Contrary to custom, it was spoken
by a woman.</p></li>

James, joined Schomberg and King William's forces at Dundalk, in 1689,
rather resembled a foreign frey-corps, than regular troops. "They were
followed by multitudes of their women; they were uncouth in their appearance;
they rode on small horses, called <i>Garrons</i>; their pistols were not fixed
in holsters, but dangled about their persons, being slung to their sword-belts;
they offered, with spirit, to make always the forlorn of the army; but, upon
the first order they received, they cried out, 'They could thrive no longer,
since they were now put under orders.'&mdash;<i>Memoirs</i>, Vol. II. p. 133. The allusion
in the next verse is to the dreadful siege of Londonderry, when the
besieged suffered the last extremities of famine. The account of this memorable
leaguer, by the author just quoted, is a most spirited piece of historical
painting.</p></li>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> Nay, I know not that: but I am sure he
is old enough to be your father; and either father,

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Joh.</span> Once again, how came you to name Morayma?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> Another damned mistake of mine: for, asking
one of my fellow-slaves, who were the chief
ladies about the house, he answered me, Morayma
and Johayma; but she, it seems, is his daughter,
with a pox to her, and you are his beloved wife.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Joh.</span> Say your beloved mistress, if you please;
for that's the title I desire. This moonshine grows

to do with two young lovers that have opportunity?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> Why, truly, conscience is something to
blame for interposing in our matters: but how can
I help it, if I have a scruple to betray my master?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Joh.</span> There must be something more in't; for your
conscience was very quiet when you took me for
Morayma.</p>

you tremble at a shadow in the moonshine.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> And you Africans are such termagants, you
stop at nothing. I must be plain with you,&mdash;you
are married, and to a holy man, the head of your
religion: go back to your chamber; go back, I say,

my part: I will be true to you, and invent all the
arguments I can to comply with you; and who
knows but at our next meeting the sweet devil
may have more power over me? I am true flesh and
blood, I can tell you that for your comfort.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Joh.</span> Flesh without blood, I think thou art; or,
if any, it is as cold as that of fishes. But I'll teach
thee, to thy cost, what vengeance is in store for refusing
a lady who has offered thee her love.&mdash;Help,

prevent what might have been betwixt him and

you better. She has been my stepmother these fifteen

no approaches to it without a shovel; but, for her
constancy, I can tell you for your comfort, she will
love till death, I mean till yours; for when she has
worn you out, she will certainly dispatch you to
another world, for fear of telling tales, as she has
already served three slaves, your predecessors, of

<h4 class="scn">SCENE II.&mdash;<i>A Night-Scene of the Mufti's Garden.</i></h4>

<p class="sdn">Enter the Mufti alone, in a Slave's Habit, like that
of <span class="cnm">Antonio.</span></p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Muf.</span> This it is to have a sound head-piece; by
this I have got to be chief of my religion; that is,
honestly speaking, to teach others what I neither
know nor believe myself. For what's Mahomet to
me, but that I get by him? Now for my policy of
this night: I have mewed up my suspected spouse
in her chamber;&mdash;no more embassies to that lusty
young stallion of a gardener. Next, my habit of a
slave; I have made myself as like him as I can, all
but his youth and vigour; which when I had, I
passed my time as well as any of my holy predecessors.
Now, walking under the windows of my
seraglio, if Johayma look out, she will certainly
take me for Antonio, and call to me; and by that
I shall know what concupiscence is working in her.
She cannot come down to commit iniquity, there's
my safety; but if she peep, if she put her nose
abroad, there's demonstration of her pious will; and
I'll not make the first precedent for a churchman to
forgive injuries.</p>

<p class="sdn">Enter <span class="cnm">Morayma,</span> running to him with a Casket in
her hand, and embracing him.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mor.</span> Now I can embrace you with a good conscience;
here are the pearls and jewels, here's my
father.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Muf.</span> I am indeed thy father; but how the devil
didst thou know me in this disguise? and what
pearls and jewels dost thou mean?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mor.</span> [<span class="sdm">Going back.</span>] What have I done, and what
will now become of me!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Muf.</span> Art thou mad, Morayma?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="pgnm">390</span><a id="page_390" name="page_390"></a>
<span class="cnm">Mor.</span> I think you'll make me so.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Muf.</span> Why, what have I done to thee? Recollect
thyself, and speak sense to me.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mor.</span> Then give me leave to tell you, you are
the worst of fathers.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Muf.</span> Did I think I had begotten such a monster!&mdash;Proceed,
my dutiful child, proceed, proceed.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mor.</span> You have been raking together a mass of
wealth, by indirect and wicked means: the spoils
of orphans are in these jewels, and the tears of widows
in these pearls.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Muf.</span> Thou amazest me!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mor.</span> I would do so. This casket is loaded with
your sins; 'tis the cargo of rapines, simony, and extortions;
the iniquity of thirty years muftiship converted
into diamonds.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Muf.</span> Would some rich railing rogue would say
as much to me, that I might squeeze his purse for
scandal!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mor.</span> No, sir, you get more by pious fools than
railers, when you insinuate into their families, manage
their fortunes while they live, and beggar
their heirs, by getting legacies, when they die.
And do you think I'll be the receiver of your theft?
I discharge my conscience of it: Here, take again
your filthy mammon, and restore it, you had best,
to the true owners.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Muf.</span> I am finely documented by my own daughter!</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mor.</span> And a great credit for me to be so: Do
but think how decent a habit you have on, and
how becoming your function to be disguised like a
slave, and eaves-dropping under the women's windows,
to be saluted, as you deserve it richly, with
a piss-pot. If I had not known you casually by
your shambling gait, and a certain reverend awkwardness
that is natural to all of your function,
<span class="pgnm">391</span><a id="page_391" name="page_391"></a>
here you had been exposed to the laughter of your
own servants; who have been in search of you
through the whole seraglio, peeping under every
petticoat to find you.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Muf.</span> Pr'ythee, child, reproach me no more of
human failings; they are but a little of the pitch
and spots of the world, that are still sticking on
me; but I hope to scour them out in time. I am
better at bottom than thou thinkest; I am not the
man thou takest me for.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mor.</span> No, to my sorrow, sir, you are not.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Muf.</span> It was a very odd beginning though, methought,
to see thee come running in upon me
with such a warm embrace; pr'ythee, what was the
meaning of that violent hot hug?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mor.</span> I am sure I meant nothing by it, but the
zeal and affection which I bear to the man of the
world, whom I may love lawfully.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Muf.</span> But thou wilt not teach me, at this age,
the nature of a close embrace?</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mor.</span> No, indeed; for my mother-in-law complains,
that you are past teaching: But if you mistook
my innocent embrace for sin, I wish heartily
it had been given where it would have been more
acceptable.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Muf.</span> Why this is as it should be now; take
the treasure again, it can never be put into better
hands.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mor.</span> Yes, to my knowledge, but it might. I
have confessed my soul to you, if you can understand
me rightly. I never disobeyed you till this
night; and now, since, through the violence of my
passion, I have been so unfortunate, I humbly beg
your pardon, your blessing, and your leave, that,
upon the first opportunity, I may go for ever from
your sight; for heaven knows, I never desire to see
you more.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Muf.</span> Why, if I have been a little pilfering, or
so, I take it bitterly of thee to tell me of it, since
it was to make thee rich; and I hope a man may
make bold with his own soul, without offence to
his own child. Here, take the jewels again; take
them, I charge thee, upon thy obedience.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Mor.</span> Well then, in virtue of obedience, I will
take them; but, on my soul, I had rather they
were in a better hand.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Muf.</span> Meaning mine, I know it.</p>

windpipe, and some part of speech.</p>

All came resolved to die in my defence,<br />

me,&mdash;my jewels, and my maidenhead.</p>

<p class="dlg"><span class="cnm">Ant.</span> Both of them intended for my worship's

we were disabled for a better.</p>

in a veil; for those eyes of thine are damned enemies
to mortification.</p>

is, that we women are allowed the privilege of
having souls; and I assure you, I shall make bold
to bestow mine upon some lover, whenever you begin

church, a private chamber will serve the turn.</p>

So let us part in the dumb pomp of grief.<br />

taken from the following passage in the "Captivity and escape of
Adam Elliot, M.A."&mdash;"By sun-rising next morning, we were all
of us, who came last to Sallee, driven to market, where, the Moors
sitting taylor-wise on stalls round about, we were severally run
up and down by persons who proclaimed our qualities or trades,
and what might best recommend us to the buyer. I had a great
black who was appointed to sell me; this fellow, holding me by the
hand, coursed me up and down from one person to another, who
called upon me at pleasure to examine what trade I was of, and
to see what labour my hands had been accustomed to. All the
seamen were soon bought up, but it was mid-day ere I could
meet with a purchaser."&mdash;See <i>A modest Vindication of Titus

where the Emperor recognises his murderer as a personage in his
vision, seems to be borrowed from the story of one of the caliphs,
who, before his death, dreamed, that a sable hand and arm shook
over his head a handful of red earth, and denounced, that such
was the colour of the earth on which he should die. When taken
ill on an expedition, he desired to know the colour of the earth
on which his tent was pitched. A negro slave presented him with
a specimen; and in the black's outstretched arm, bared, from respect,
to the elbow, as well as in the colour of the earth, the caliph
acknowledged the apparition he had seen in his sleep, and
prepared for immediate death.</p></li>

<li><a id="Sebas_6-10" name="Sebas_6-10"></a><p>This incident seems to be taken from the following passage in
the <i>Continuation of the Adventures of Don Sebastian</i>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In Moran, an island some half league from Venice, there is
an abbot called Capelo, a gentleman of Venice, a grave personage,
and of great authority, hearing that the king laid wait for certain
jewels that he had lost, (hoping thereby to recover some of them,)
having a diamond in his keeping with the arms of Portugal, came
to the town to the conventicles of St Francis, called Frari, where
the king lay concealed, for that he was pursued by some that
meant him no good, who no sooner beheld the ring, but he said,
'Verily this is mine, and I either lost the same in Flanders, or
else it was stolen from me.' And when the king had put it upon
his finger, it appeared otherwise engraven than before. The abbot
enquiring of him that brought him the ring, how he came by
it? he answered, it is true that the king hath said. Hence arose
a strange rumour of a ring, that, by turning the stone, you might
discern three great letters engraven, S.R.P. as much as to say,
<i>Sebastianus Rex Portugallix."&mdash;Harl. Mis.</i> vol. v. p. 462.</p>
</blockquote></li>

<li><a id="Sebas_6-11" name="Sebas_6-11"></a><p>It is said, in the pamphlets alluded to, that Don Sebastian,
out of grief and shame for having fought against the advice of his
generals, and lost the flower of his army, took the resolution of
never returning to his country, but of burying himself in a hermitage;
and that he resided for three years as an anchorite, on the
top of a mountain in Dalmatia.</p></li>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
